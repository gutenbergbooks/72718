<p class="chaptitle">WHAT THE MOON SAW IN THE MIDWAY.</p>


<p>“Eight days I have haunted this beehive,
fought my way through the multitude, looked
into tens of thousands of faces, and yet failed
to find her. I’m afraid, Aleck Craig, you’re
on a wild goose chase, and the sooner you
return to Montreal the better for your peace
of mind. Eight days! and six of them spent
amid the infernal clatter of this bedlam. I’ve
been wondering what the sensations of a man
would be, could he go to sleep in Canada and
awaken right <i>here</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>The tall, well-built pilgrim from over the
border, dressed in a quiet suit of Scotch
cheviot and carrying a Japanese cane, purchased
no doubt in the bazaar, laughs softly
as in imagination he pictures the bewilderment
and positive alarm that would overwhelm
an unfortunate placed in the midst of his
present surroundings suddenly.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is a conglomeration of sounds
that would appall the bravest heart unaware
of their particular origin. The hum of many
voices marks the presence of a multitude;
from over the buildings across the way come
the many cries that day and night accompany
the riding of the camels and donkeys in Cairo
Street; here and there shout the bunco-steerers
who officiate at the doors of various
so-called Oriental theaters; fakirs howl their
wares—from “bum-bum candy” to hot
waffles and trinkets—while the ear-distracting
tom-tom music, from behind the gate leading
to the Javanese village, throbs like the pulsations
of a heart. Above all this infernal din
can be distinctly heard the steady “clack—clack”
of the ponderous Ferris wheel as it
slowly revolves in its course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Such a kaleidescopic scene had never before
been witnessed on earth. Since the day
when, at the Tower of Babel, the confusion of
tongues came upon the multitude of workers,
there has not been a time when the civilized
and savage nations of the earth held such
a congress as on the Midway Plaisance of
Chicago.</p>

<p>There is always a crowd here. Many come
for the excitement; others because of the
grand opportunity afforded them to study
these queer people from all lands. The red
fez abounds, but everyone wearing it is not
necessarily a Turk or an Arab, or even an
Algerian. It is the head gear of the Midway,
and those who have business here don it as a
matter of course.</p>

<p>In his way, Aleck Craig is something of a
philosopher. He has not been abroad, but
takes an intense interest in the strange things
of other lands, and perhaps it is the opportunity
presented by this gathering of nations
that causes him to haunt the Midway. His
muttered words would indicate another
motive also.</p>

<p>As a relief from the turmoil that is so incessant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
the Canadian turns into the Turkish
bazaar near by. Here are booths after booths
of embroideries, trinkets, rugs, and the various
goods to be found in Constantinople,
from jewelry to the quaint but expensive
swords used by the Moslem people of the
Orient. Some of these booths are presided
over by boys and young men. They may be
Jews, but the red fez gives them a Turkish
appearance. So with the young women.
They are hardly Orientals, for they speak
clear English, and the customs of Turkey
forbid the presence of a female on the streets
unless the detestable <i>yashmak</i> conceals her
face.</p>

<p>Here the noise is less intense. Aleck has
many times retired to this place for rest. It
is a gaudy scene when lighted up, and he
would always remember it in days to come.</p>

<p>Being socially inclined, he has made several
acquaintances in the bazaar, with whom he
stops from time to time and chats. One of
these is a Turk of middle age, a man of stout
figure and closely cropped beard in which
the gray is sprinkled like pepper and salt.
Aleck finds much to interest him in the conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
of Aroun Scutari, the dealer in
precious stones of the Turkish bazaar.</p>

<p>The other has traveled all over Europe, has
been in the Egyptian army, and impresses the
Canadian as a remarkable man. He pays
little attention to his business, leaving it
almost entirely in the hands of an Armenian,
in whom he seems to have implicit confidence.
So Craig shrewdly judges that the Turk has
hardly come to the great World’s Fair to increase
his fortune. Various motives bring
men here, and it is hardly right to speculate
upon their private reasons.</p>

<p>Leaving the gem dealer, he saunters on to
pass a few sentences with a wide-awake
foreigner who invites the public to step in
and view the beauties of Jerusalem through
the aid of stereoscopic views.</p>

<p>Upon passing the glittering booth of Scutari
again, he sees the stout Turk in earnest conversation
with a man who wears a fez, but
who sports a blond mustache, and at sight
of whom Aleck receives something of a
shock.</p>

<p>Instead of passing out of the bazaar, he
lingers around, watching for this individual,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
who soon comes lounging along, smoking a
pipe, with the most careless abandon in the
world. A cane of bamboo raps upon his arm:
he glances down at the spot, brushes some
imaginary dirt from his sleeve, and then raises
his eyes to the party at the other end of the
cane.</p>

<p>“Wycherley, my boy, how are you?”
says that individual, smiling.</p>

<p>“Do my eyes deceive me—can I believe the
evidence of my vision? Is it Aleck Craig, or
his double?” says the party addressed,
slowly putting out his hand to meet that proffered
him.</p>

<p>The clasp of the muscular Canadian comes
direct from the heart, and Wycherley shows
signs of sudden devotion—although no muezzin
chants the <i>aden</i>, or call to prayer, from the
minaret of the Mohammedan mosque near by,
he makes a move as though about to drop to
his knees.</p>

<p>“Mercy, you Canadian bear. Now I know
you are Aleck. No other man has a grip like
that. Keep it, I beg, for your fellow-athletes.
I believe you’ve crushed the bones in my
hand. I’ll beware of you next time. Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
what brings you here—how long do you stay—what
business are you in?”</p>

<p>He rattles these sentences off in a dramatic
way, for having once been a Thespian, a
wandering “barn-stormer,” Claude Alan
Wycherley could not even ask a waiter for a
little more hash without throwing into the
simple request an oratorical effect so picturesque,
that the poor devil would be apt to
drop the plate in his sudden trepidation.</p>

<p>“Of course I’m doing the Fair, and, as you
know my failing with regard to studying
human nature, you can understand this
quaint Midway has strong attractions for
me,” answers the Canadian.</p>

<p>“So they all say! Everyone comes here to
study human nature,” laughs the ex-actor,
waving his pipe around—they have stepped
outside and are on the edge of the multitude
thronging the Plaisance—“but I give you the
benefit of the doubt, my boy. Yes, I do
remember your penchant of old. Nor have I
forgotten that I owe my life to the champion
of the Montreal Snowshoe Club.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Don’t bring up that thing
again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“Of course it was a trifling matter to you,
my boy, but to me it meant all the difference
between life and death. I was lost; I should
have frozen, for my snowshoes were broken.
You came and saved me, God bless you,
Craig.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” asks the
other, as he shows a desire to change the
subject, and glancing meaningly at the fez
Wycherley wears.</p>

<p>The latter chuckles; his disposition seems
to be a genial one.</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, Aleck, I’m studying
human nature, too. Just now I’m passing
through an apprenticeship. I make it an
object to spend as I go, and each night I
throw away what I have made during the day.”</p>

<p>“If you’re the same old rolling stone I
knew a year or two ago, that isn’t probably a
very hard business,” smiles Aleck, for good-natured
Claude was usually in a chronic state
of financial collapse, yet he would cheerfully
bestow his last nickel in charity.</p>

<p>“You’re quite correct; but there are times
when it bothers me just what to do with certain
sums.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>“Indeed! That is news. Glad to hear you
have been so lucky. Thinking of starting any
hospitals, sanitariums, orphan asylums?”</p>

<p>“They’ll all come to-morrow, if fortune is
kind,” returns the man with the fez.</p>

<p>Craig steals a side look at him, as though
wondering whether this is a joke or the other
has gone mad.</p>

<p>“What has to-day done for you, then?”
he asks, bent upon solving the mystery,
whereupon Claude deliberately takes out
a notebook, turns over the pages, and
sighs:</p>

<p>“I made a poor investment, which cuts a
big figure in the whole, so my profits for the
day only amount to the pitiful sum of seventeen
thousand, three hundred and eleven.”</p>

<p>“Dollars?” exclaims the astonished Aleck.</p>

<p>“Why, certainly,” nods the other; “and
that is a wretched showing in comparison to
some others I could pick out in here,” tapping
the wonderful notebook affectionately.</p>

<p>The Canadian draws a long puff at his cigar,
as though reflecting. Then he turns suddenly
upon his companion and says:</p>

<p>“I see how it is, my dear fellow; you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
running the Midway—it is a little private
speculation of yours.”</p>

<p>“No, no; I deny the soft impeachment,”
returns the Chicagoan, laughing heartily.</p>

<p>“At least you own the Ferris wheel? Now
don’t deny that.”</p>

<p>“I must. True, I took in tickets at the
entrance for a time, and even pushed people
into the cars, but when I went into this other
colossal business I had to give that up. No
man could continually put twenty people
where ten ought to go, and at the same time
do justice to great deals involving <i>millions</i>.”</p>

<p>“You are right, my boy. But will you
kindly relieve my suspense and tell me the
nature of this marvelous business.”</p>

<p>Wycherley removes his pipe and says
laconically:</p>

<p>“You’ve heard of Wall Street. Well, we
have no Wall Street in Chicago, but we’ve
got the greatest lot of hustlers in the grain
pit you ever heard of, from Hutchinson, in
days gone by, to old Samson Cereal, the grain
king of to-day. Now you understand why
I gave up a lucrative office; now you can see
where the immense profits come in. Why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
look here,” snatching out the book again and
showing a closely written page, “there’s what
will to-morrow either win or lose me a cool
million.”</p>

<p>Craig begins to be amused.</p>

<p>“Oh! and I presume you’re quite prepared
to meet your losses if fortune is against
you?”</p>

<p>Wycherley, a modern Dick Swiveller in
all his rattle-brained, devil-may-care ways,
shrugs his shoulders.</p>

<p>“If the fair goddess refuses me her favor,
I’ll have to carry it over to the next day.”</p>

<p>“Your creditors are very obliging.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! don’t you understand, old fellow?
I said I was an apprentice; I’m making a
deep study of this grain gambling on ’Change.
It’s my intention to devote myself to it after
I’ve got the secret of success down fine. I’m
only betting with myself, you see. Some
days I’m depressed by heavy losses; then
again I’m on the top of the swim—my name
famous as a high-roller. You don’t know
how exciting it is to take up an afternoon
paper in a delightful state of uncertainty as
to whether you have won or lost a fortune.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“Ahem! it must be, indeed. See here, how
long have you been at this odd game?”</p>

<p>“About three weeks.”</p>

<p>“Doing a big business, I presume?”</p>

<p>Claude thrusts his thumbs in the armholes
of his vest, and swells with importance.</p>

<p>“I’ve handled millions, my dear fellow;
made some of the boldest moves ever known;
expect to be the Napoleon of the wheat pit
ere long.”</p>

<p>“Well, how do you stand?” continues
Craig, thoroughly interested in this queer
freak of his entertaining companion.</p>

<p>“Stand?” echoes Claude.</p>

<p>“Yes; what have the profits, imaginary of
course, been?”</p>

<p>“H’m! Well, I was figuring up this evening,
and if I’m lucky to-morrow——”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And win that cool million——”</p>

<p>“We’ll take that for granted, my dear
boy.”</p>

<p>“And no beggar of a broker goes back on
his contract, I’ll be just thirteen dollars ahead
of the game.”</p>

<p class="chaptitle">HOW SAMSON CEREAL STOLE A BRIDE IN
TURKEY.</p>


<p>Craig turns and looks squarely in the face
of his companion. His Canadian sense of
humor does not grasp the situation as readily
as would have been the case with an American,
but gradually a smile creeps over his
countenance.</p>

<p>“Then if luck follows you, my dear Claude,
I shall know where to go if I want to make a
loan,” he says, and the other joins in the
laugh.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ll give me credit for having
a long head when you know <i>all</i>,” pursues
Wycherley, with a mysterious nod.</p>

<p>“Then there is still something more back of
it?”</p>

<p>“I should say so. This brain-racking mental
calculation is only a means to an end.
Should the plan carry out I’m a goner,” with
a sigh.</p>

<p>“Come, this is very unlike you, my dear
fellow, to keep one in suspense so long. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
there’s a story back of it all, let’s have it.
You always found me a sympathetic listener.
Come, wet your lips with a mug of this French
cider, served by a divinity in wooden shoes,
and then I’ll listen to your tale of woe.”</p>

<p>When this ceremony has been completed,
they saunter toward the great Ferris wheel
near by, which continues to revolve, its
electric-lighted arch spanning the heavens,
the most remarkable object in this feast of
wonders.</p>

<p>“Now, tell me what you mean by a
'goner.’ If your plans carry, you ought to
be happy, Claude.”</p>

<p>“True, true; but you see I’m now thirty-three,
and I’ve been <i>so</i> free from care. It
will be a tremendous thing for me to assume
the responsibility for another,” sighs the
Chicagoan.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see! you intend taking a partner.”</p>

<p>“For weal or woe,” groaning.</p>

<p>“Not get married, my boy?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid there’s some truth in it, though
the matter rests on certain conditions. Do
you know, it worries me considerably?”</p>

<p>“I should think it would. You have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
a regular Bohemian, living from hand to
mouth, always cheerful and contented. Now
you will have to turn over a new leaf and go
to work.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so; but somehow you’ve got the
cart before the horse. It has happened before
now that the wife has supported the husband.”</p>

<p>“Wycherley, I didn’t think that of you.”</p>

<p>“Well,” resumes the other with a little
laugh, “I suppose I’d have my hands full
looking after her stocks and bonds, as a sort
of agent or manager. That is one reason I’ve
devoted myself to the markets so assiduously
of late—ever since the subject has been
broached, in fact.”</p>

<p>“Then the lady is—ahem—very wealthy?”</p>

<p>“Im—<i>mensely</i> so.”</p>

<p>“Accept my congratulations, Wycherley.
May you——”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Aleck, my boy; it isn’t all
settled yet.”</p>

<p>“Father object?”</p>

<p>“I’m not bothering much about him.”</p>

<p>“Then you mean the day hasn’t been set.
That’s a difficulty easily overcome, my boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>The retired Thespian gives a melo-dramatic
groan.</p>

<p>“Confound it all! thanks to this modesty on
my part, though I’ve seen the dear girl dozens
of times, I’ve never dared address her.”</p>

<p>Craig remains silent. In his mind he is
resolving the question of his friend’s sanity.
He has known him for a jolly dog in times
gone by, but his eccentricities as revealed on
this occasion certainly stamp him the most
astonishing and original fellow Craig has ever
met.</p>

<p>“See here, Wycherley, you’re bent on
muddling me up to-night. Explain this
puzzle. How is it you are bent on marrying a
girl to whom, as you confess, you have never
even been introduced?” he finally demands
somewhat shortly, as if a suspicion has flashed
across his brain that the other may be guying
him—Craig has had previous acquaintance
with such practical jokes as Americans love to
play.</p>

<p>“Oh, he will fix all that!” returns Claude,
knocking the ashes from his pipe, with a
manner that speaks of remarkable <i>sang froid</i>.</p>

<p>“He? You will have to explain who is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
meant. Have you entered into a league with
the father?”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! no. It’s Aroun Scutari, the
Turk.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I know him! I saw you talking with
him. Has he a daughter?”</p>

<p>“Heaven knows. He has a harem full of
wives over in Stamboul. That’s how it all
came about, you see.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see. I’m as much in the dark
as ever. Now, if you prefer not to take me
into your confidence——”</p>

<p>“Aleck, on the contrary I am delighted
with the chance. Something about this business
goes against my grain. I’ve always been
a rolling stone, a harum-scarum sort of fellow,
but I don’t know that I ever did a bad deed
in my life. Yes, I believe your running
across me to-night is a blessing. You can be
a father confessor.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<p>“And having heard my little lay, tell me
whether it would be awful wicked for me to
win a wife by such fraud. Understand in the
beginning, my intentions are honorable. If I
refuse the job someone else will take it, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
Samson Cereal’s daughter be won by a wretch
who will abuse his privilege. Hence, though
sworn to bachelorhood, I have deemed it my
duty to put aside my scruples and——Jove!
I’ve been forgetting myself—what time have
you?”</p>

<p>“Just a quarter to nine.”</p>

<p>Wycherley shrugs his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Then the time has come. I question my
nerve to carry out the contract,” he mutters.</p>

<p>“Contract?” echoes the Canadian athlete.</p>

<p>Wycherley is looking at him steadily, as
though possessed of a sudden notion.</p>

<p>“I believe he’d do it,” is what he mutters,
as he surveys Aleck’s muscular, well-knit
figure, and then casts a glance of scorn at his
own stout form.</p>

<p>“Craig, have you been on the wheel to-night?”
he asks suddenly.</p>

<p>“No, and I confess it was my intention to
go up before leaving. I’ve been waiting for a
moon as near the full as we could get it overhead.
If you’ll go as my guest, I accept.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. I told you I worked there—all
the boys are known to me. Besides, it will
be so arranged that you and I shall occupy a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
car alone. Then, as we mount upward, and
look down upon these remarkable sights, I will
a tale unfold, which, if it does not make your
blood tingle will at least arouse your interest.
Perhaps you may have difficulty in believing
it, but stranger things are happening in this
nineteenth century and at the World’s Fair
than ever enter into your philosophy, Horatio!
Here we are. Now watch me.”</p>

<p>Wycherley seems to stand back as though
awaiting a certain car. How it is done, the
Canadian knows not, for he sees no signals exchanged,
but presently he finds himself with
his singular companion in one of the cars in
which they are the only passengers.</p>

<p>“First of all, notice this,” says Wycherley,
as he points to the door that is ajar.</p>

<p>“Against orders. I thought the system
was perfect on the Ferris wheel, and every
door locked.”</p>

<p>“So it is, usually. To-night there is a substitute
on duty—that is all.”</p>

<p>He makes this remark in a significant tone,
which at once stamps it as a fact upon which
theories may be built, and Aleck remembers
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>“Now,” continues the disciple of Forrest
and Booth, in an impressive way, “our time
for conversation is limited to about one revolution.
I have a story to tell connected with
the fortunes of Aroun Scutari and Samson
Cereal, and you will excuse me if I plunge
into the details without further delay.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure,” remarks the Canadian,
who stands looking out upon the remarkable
scene that, as they rise higher and higher,
gradually unfolds before their vision until it
looks like fairy-land—the Administration
building standing out above all else, with its
myriads of electric sparks showing the outlines
of the dome, while ever and anon, as the
moon hides behind a passing cloud, the search
lights sweep across the fair grounds like lightning
flashes from the skies, crossing and recrossing
in mystic symbols.</p>

<p>“Going back nearly twenty years, the grain
king of Chicago, Samson Cereal, was in
Turkey. I believe he was a United States
consul at one of the ports, perhaps Constantinople
itself. Let that pass.</p>

<p>“By a series of strange circumstances,
when traveling in Georgia—a place over in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
Asia where their greatest industry seems to
be raising beautiful girls to be sold as wives
to wealthy Turks—he met a young woman
named Marda, as lovely as an houri. She bewitched
the American, and as he had been
taken wounded to her father’s house he had
opportunities for talking with the object of
his mad devotion. So, as was quite natural,
they fell in love.</p>

<p>“Now, anyone that knows old Samson
to-day would be inclined to doubt that the
cool, calculating manipulator of wheat could
ever have been a Hotspur, ready to dare all for
love, yet it is quite true. Imagine his despair
when the object of his adoration, while admitting
a return of his love, coolly told him
the fates had decreed it otherwise; that she
was destined to be the wife of a great pasha;
money had already been paid to her parents,
and they were in honor bound to see that
when the attendants, now on the way from
Stamboul, arrived, she should go to the beautiful
harem of the pasha.</p>

<p>“Well, Samson just up and stormed. He
swore to the Georgian beauty that as she
loved him, by that love she belonged to him—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
he would have her, and take her to his
country where one wife is all they allow a
man to have.</p>

<p>“This appeared to strike the lovely girl as
quite a delightful thing. It ended in her
declaring that if Samson won her she was his.</p>

<p>“As the representative of the pasha and his
suite appeared about the time this bargain
was struck, there was no time to do anything
then; but Samson was fully aroused and laid
his plans. In this first speculation of his life
he showed the same shrewdness that has of
late years raised him to the proud pinnacle of
'king of the wheat pit.’</p>

<p>“Having learned the exact route the company
would take on their way to Stamboul—for
there seems to be some formal ceremony
about such affairs—he mounted a horse and
departed in hot haste.</p>

<p>“The result was just what he figured on.
Such a shock old Constantinople had not received
since the Crimean War. Even convulsed
as the Turks were over the impending
war with Russia, they became furious when it
was learned that the caravan bearing the intended
bride of a pasha had been attacked by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
a band of savage Kurds under an American,
the horses all stolen and the beautiful Marda
carried away.</p>

<p>“Samson had laid his plans well. I reckon
he had the story of young Lochinvar in his
mind. At any rate, he rode furiously on to
the city, where he had almost to bankrupt
himself in chartering a small steamer. Once
on this they had just so many hours to pass
the forts at the straits. I believe a shot or
two were fired after them, but it was too late,
for evening came on, and the brave American
had won his bride.”</p>

<p>“You have deeply interested me. Love is
indeed a giant in leveling difficulties. We are
now nearing the top—the view is magnificent—but
as yet I am not able to apply your
story to present conditions.”</p>

<p>“Patience, and all will be made clear, dear
boy.”</p>

</div>

<p class="chaptitle">THE STRANGE PLOT OF THE FERRIS WHEEL.</p>


<p>“What I have told you reflects only honor
upon the name of an American. I now come
to the part that is hard to believe, and yet I
swear every word is true as gospel.</p>

<p>“The pasha whose bride was stolen, you
have met. Aroun Scutari is the man. He
comes to the Fair nominally as a dealer in
precious stones, but actually to satisfy a
revenge that has been slumbering these twenty
years. A Turk never forgets nor forgives an
insult or injury, and it so happened that he
was madly infatuated with the lovely houri
Samson carried away—something rather unusual
with a pasha who can buy as many
wives as he cares to support.</p>

<p>“His vengeance slept because he learned
that a year after reaching America Samson’s
lovely wife died. Chicago’s climate was too
severe for the hothouse flower. She left a
child, and upon this girl the old broker has lavished
his love. How the Turk learned all this
I can’t say, but he came here determined to repay
the long standing debt he owed a Yankee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know whether the pasha knew
Samson lived in Chicago, but he felt sure he
would come to the Fair, and he bided his time.
Sure enough, one day they met face to face,
and with the old operator was his charming
daughter.</p>

<p>“In Constantinople these two men had
known each other. The eyes of hate are keen.
One look they flashed into each other’s face
and with a frown and a grunt passed on.</p>

<p>“The curiosity of the girl was aroused by
the peculiar meeting. Her father for certain
reasons has, it seems, never told her the
strange story of the past, and she does not
know he won her mother while she was on
the way to a Turk’s harem. She is not like
other girls. Although now but nineteen years
of age she has traveled much with friends, but
never to Turkey. Anywhere else she was
given full liberty to go, but never there;
which, of course, aroused all manner of conjectures
in her mind, and when she saw the awful
look Aroun Scutari bent on her father she
must in some way have connected it with his
horror of the Moslem country.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you how the cunning pasha<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
went to work; but I am positive that the
middle-aged lady who usually accompanies
Samson’s daughter has been bought body and
soul by his gold, and is playing into his hands.</p>

<p>“It has puzzled me to know why he selected
me as an agent. Sometimes I think it isn’t at
all complimentary to my character, and then
when I get puzzling over the matter I’m forced
to believe that after all it’s for the best—'there’s
a destiny that shapes our ends, rough
hew them as we may.’</p>

<p>“In a spirit of deviltry, I pretended to fall
in with the Turk’s plans at the start, and once
having committed myself, I’ve been borne
along by the current in an irresistible manner,
until here I am at the crisis, confused and
ready to snatch at a straw in order to escape.”</p>

<p>The wheel stops while they are at the top
of the great circle. From below comes the
strangest conglomeration of sounds with
which the human ear was ever tortured:
music from the German band, the infernal din
of Javanese, Hottentot, South Sea Islanders,
and their like, the shrieks that burst from the
camel racers and the donkey riders in Cairo
Street, together with laughter, shouts, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
cries arising from the masses thronging the
Midway—will its equal ever be heard again?</p>

<p>Again the rumble of machinery, and they
experience the strange sensations of the descent.
Wycherley begins to show more excitement
as the time draws closer for the
crisis of which he has spoken.</p>

<p>“Now to explain the strange plan by
means of which I am to at once walk into the
good graces of Miss Cereal. Heaven knows it
is wild enough, and could only originate in
the hair-brained mind of a Turk. I suggested
various other schemes that would accomplish
the same result, but he would have none of
them, so here am I about to imperil my life
to-night, unless my nerve gives way, which I
fear it surely will, in order to appear a hero
in the eyes of the great operator’s daughter.</p>

<p>“I have tried to find out what plans Scutari
has beyond, but it’s useless, for he’s as close
mouthed as an oyster. In secret, I am to woo
and, when the time comes, marry. Beyond
that all is a blank. At times I have wondered
if the Turk didn’t plan to return a Roland for
an Oliver—that as Samson had stolen his
purchased bride years ago, he will now make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
it square by securing his daughter. That, I
have been content to leave for the future.
You see, such good fortune is a rarity with me,
and I was just content to drift along, taking
life easy, pretending to fall in with the plans
of the pasha, who doubtless believes me a
rogue, while at the same time I was scheming
how to turn the game against him at the last.
Thus time has flown, the Turk did not plan in
vain, and let me tell you, Aleck Craig, I am
on this monster wheel to-night to carry out
the wildest scheme mortal brain ever conceived,
as I said before, with the sole purpose
in view of apparently saving the millionaire’s
daughter from a terrible danger.”</p>

<p>“The deuce you are!” says the Canadian,
looking around him in wonder, for it is beyond
his comprehension how such a Quixotic
knight may serve his lady love under such
conditions.</p>

<p>“Now listen. We are almost down. The
car ahead of us will be emptied. If arrangements
that have been carefully made are
carried out, it will receive a party in waiting.
These are to be all women with one exception.
This is a man with long hair and glasses—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
professor in appearance and quite respectable,
whose wife urges him to make the trip, and
almost drags him into the car which is at once
closed and the door barred.</p>

<p>“As soon as it begins to ascend he will
jump up and try to force his way out. His
excitement increases as he goes up until he is
like a crazy man. Of course the women are
alarmed, and when the wretched wife shouts
that the professor, whose mind is always
affected even when ascending an ordinary
elevator, has gone crazy and will murder them
all, you just bet there’ll be the biggest screaming
match the Midway ever heard—old Cairo
with its camels won’t be in it.</p>

<p>“Now is my turn, you see. The door of
my car is unfastened. I hear the cries for
help in the car above as we ascend. What
Chicagoan ever heard and did not answer a
woman’s appeal. There is deadly danger in
it, but I’ve worked on this wheel and ought to
know something about it.</p>

<p>“As it stops a minute to take on a fresh
load below, I slip out, seize hold of the
girders, and climb up to the car above. It
seems impossible to do this, and yet I assure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
you the thing is feasible. All it needs is a
strong pair of arms, a quick eye, and a bold
heart; and, confound it, I’m afraid I’m lacking
in the last! What d’ye think of the scheme,
my boy?”</p>

<p>Craig laughs outright.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve
heard in many a day. I feel it my duty to
stop it if possible. The door is open; I shall
call out to the man below.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. He wouldn’t pay any attention
to you. The chances are my nerve will
fail me, anyhow. See here—they are about to
enter the car. Notice the girl who steps like
a queen, in company with the middle-aged
lady in black. That is Dorothy!”</p>

<p>“Dorothy—yes, by Heavens, it is the
same!” ejaculates Craig, suddenly fixing his
gaze on the face that has haunted his dreams.</p>

<p>“Do you know her?” cries Claude, aghast.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes, that is—this infamous plot
must go no further, do you hear?” and the
Canadian turns upon his companion savagely.</p>

<p>“So far as I am concerned I confess I’m
only too glad to be out of it, my noble duke.
But you see, we are in motion—they ascend—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
wheel cannot go backward, and I’m really
afraid the ladies must be terribly alarmed by
the antics of that mad professor, unless some
athletic hero like yourself climbs to their
rescue. As for me, it’s too much like being
suspended by a spider’s web. I admit at the
last a yearning for <i>terra firma</i>.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” exclaimed Craig.</p>

<p>“The first scream above. Most likely the
professor is warming up. The worst of it is,
his wife assured me it was not wholly a put-up
job on his part. He is always inclined
toward mania when ascending or descending
an elevator or inclined plane. My only fear
is that he may really become crazy enough to
do one or more of the ladies injury.”</p>

<p>“Good God!” cries Craig, horrified; “and
you entered into this base conspiracy. I’m
ashamed of you, Wycherley.”</p>

<p>“Ditto, my dear boy. I feel like kicking
myself. That old Turk must have bewitched
me. I meant it all for the best. You see, I
was afraid he’d find someone not so scrupulous
about the result.”</p>

<p>Craig has not waited to hear the apologies
of his companion, but springing to the door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
dashes it open. The sight is one to appall the
bravest heart. Already they are nearly halfway
up the rise of the great wheel that clicks
and rolls onward like a giant Juggernaut. Below
lies the Midway—nearly one hundred and
forty feet—the myriads of lights flashing from
Moorish palace, Mohammedan mosque and
bazaars, Chinese temples, Egyptian theater,
and the motley collections of fake shows that
entice money from the pockets of pilgrims in
the Plaisance. Above, the moon and the
star-decked heavens, against which is outlined
the circle of cars suspended, like Mohammed’s
coffin, in space.</p>

<p>“By my soul, I believe it can be done,”
says the Canadian, as, thrusting his head out,
he notices the position they are in; “yes, it is
possible to climb up this great tire of the
wheel, this outside circle.”</p>

<p>The wheel ceases to revolve, and as he
stands there in the doorway he no longer
looks down. Above the muffled din below he
hears shrieks from above, shrieks for help
uttered by terrified women.</p>

<p>Perhaps, understanding how matters are, he
might be tempted to remain inactive, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
danger is enough to alarm even a braver man
than Claude Wycherley, who has backed out
at the last moment.</p>

<p>It is the memory of a face that decides him.
<i>She</i> is there! He has found her at last,
and under most remarkable circumstances—Dorothy,
the speculator’s daughter, heroine of
the strange story he has just heard.</p>

<p>Louder rise the screams above; in imagination
he can see her in danger at the hands of a
madman. The strain is too much; he flings
off his coat with a quick movement.</p>

<p>“What would you do?” cries the other,
leaping toward the Canadian.</p>

<p>“Change cars,” is the cool response thrown
in his face, as the athlete springs upon the
great iron framework and begins to mount
upward.</p>

<p>“Come back! it is too late, man. Good
Heavens! the wheel begins to move. Come
back!” shouts Claude, thrilled with the
sight. But it is as easy to go forward as to
return, and with hands of steel clutching the
rim of the throbbing wheel, Aleck Craig
climbs upward to meet his fate in mid air.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="chaptitle">BRAVO, CANUCK!</p>


<p>To falter, to lose his grasp upon the cold
iron of the immense wheel means instantaneous
death, since he is now high above the
battlements of the Midway, whose loftiest
structure does not dare to mount on a
level with the monster shaft of the Ferris
wheel.</p>

<p>Craig is a thorough athlete, his muscles
trained by a generous indulgence in the manly
sports for which fair Montreal is noted. With
only an Indian hunter as a companion he has
crossed mountains of snow and rivers of ice on
snowshoes, in search of the great moose, or
the caribou of Newfoundland. As a skater
he has held a championship medal several
seasons. Modest in his manner, he makes no
boast of these things, but those who know
him understand the power of that well-knit
frame.</p>

<p>It may be safely said that never before in
all his life has Aleck Craig experienced such a
queer sensation as when halfway between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
two cars, and clinging to the iron framework
he feels a throbbing sensation that tells him
the giant wheel is again in motion.</p>

<p>Above, below, around him is space; his
only hold upon the cumbersome iron band
so icy cold. Hushed are the myriad sounds
from the festive Midway now, so far as his ear
is concerned; he only hears the steady clamp—clamp
of the revolving wheel, and the
shrieks of feminine terror that continue to
come from the car just above.</p>

<p>Not one instant does he allow the thought
of personal danger to handicap his efforts.
He has started in this desperate game and
must see it through to the end. Not that he
expects any glory to descend upon his head on
account of what he may do. Wycherley has
confessed to a fear lest the professor actually
does an injury to one or more of the ladies
in the car, and it is this that has urged the
Canadian to undertake this terrible risk. The
days of chivalry are not entirely gone, even
though we live in the matter-of-fact, prosaic
nineteenth century.</p>

<p>In one way Craig’s task is not so difficult—he
finds a means of holding on with hands and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
knees, for there are protuberances upon the
wheel which he is quick to utilize.</p>

<p>He casts one look down, but no more.
That glance will never be forgotten until his
dying day. The Midway seems a mile below,
the moving wheel causes a peculiar sensation
to pass over him, a dizzy feeling, as though
the earth were receding, and some mighty
bird were carrying him up, up, higher and
higher each second.</p>

<p>After that one terrible experience Craig
dares not turn his head again, though there
seems to be a wonderful alluring feature, a
sort of deadly fascination, about the scene
below. Perhaps others have felt something of
this same sensation in another form, concerning
that same wonderful Plaisance.</p>

<p>Now he has reached the bottom of the car,
which is just about beginning to move upon
the upper half of the arc. This favors his
desperate plans, for the door is within his
reach as he hangs upon the massive tire of
this most stupendous of wheels.</p>

<p>The cries coming from the car are agonizing
in the extreme. Surely the professor must
have left the boundary of sham and entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
upon the mad reality. He can be heard roaring
there like an enraged tiger. Several of
the windows have been broken, but the wire
netting prevents him from casting himself out.
He raves like a madman. Presently his mood
may take another turn—prevented from leaping
into space by the wisdom of the Ferris
wheel management in fastening the doors and
screening the windows of the cars, he may
attempt violence upon his fellow-voyagers
through the air. What may not a crazy man
do when mania is upon him?</p>

<p>Craig shuts his teeth hard together, and
does not allow this dread to distract his attention
from the serious business before him. It
so happens that just as he gains a position
where the door is within his reach, the wheel
ceases to move.</p>

<p>This gives him an opportunity of which he
is quick to take advantage. Although the
door cannot be opened from the inside, it is
not hard to open from the outside.</p>

<p>As he succeeds in opening it the young
Canadian gazes upon a scene that arouses all
the fighting blood in his veins, for like his
cousins across the water in that “tight little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
island,” he will never look on inactive when a
brave heart is needed along with a stout arm
to protect the weak.</p>

<p>The crazy professor is a terror—his hair is
in a condition of chaos that would drive a
Yale football player green with envy, and
delight the soul of an erratic pianoforte
player of the Polish type. Upon his face
there has come a wild look that is not assumed.
They played with fire when they
selected the professor to engage in this game,
for it becomes a reality to him.</p>

<p>There he is, wildly flinging his long arms
about his head, thundering phrases in Latin
and Greek and Sanscrit, with Heaven alone
knows what grammatical correctness, and
raging from one end of the car to the other,
just as the lions in Hagenbeck’s cages do
while looking at the crowds below.</p>

<p>Whenever he approaches a group of the
women there rises a series of the most ear-piercing
shrieks, and the fluttering that followed
would remind a sportsman of a covey
of partridges flushed by his dog.</p>

<p>In this one glance Craig sees volumes. He
notices one woman dressed in a garb that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
would proclaim her a Sister in some sacred
convent, telling her beads with feverish eagerness,
and whenever the mad professor passes
by swinging his arms like great flails, she
holds in front of her a small crucifix, as
though confident that bodily harm cannot
reach the one who crouches behind this emblem
of the Church.</p>

<p>One alone of all the dozen occupants of the
car does not engage in these outbursts of
terror. Aleck notices this fact and it makes a
deep impression upon him.</p>

<p>This is Dorothy. She stands there, white of
face it is true, and doubtless trembling in
every limb, as is quite natural, considering
the terrible situation, but not a sound escapes
her lips, nor does she fly to the other end of
the car when the cause of all this turmoil
approaches.</p>

<p>Dorothy has traveled far and wide, and this
alone has given her a spirit of bravery and independence
far beyond the usual run of her
sex.</p>

<p>The scene is appalling, and no one can tell
how it may end, but thus far she holds her
ground. Perhaps the spirit that caused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
Samson Cereal to run away with the mother
has descended to the daughter. She does not
appear to be armed, and yet Aleck notes that
one hand is concealed from view amid the
folds of her rich silken dress. It is not unusual
for the American girl of to-day to own
a revolver. They are made of the finest of
steel, exquisitely fashioned, and look more
like a toy than a deadly weapon.</p>

<p>He does not wait; all these things are before
him, so that one sweeping glance shows
him the whole. Then his feet touch the floor
of the car, and at the same moment the great
triumph of American engineering again
moves, the iron circle with its dangling cars
starting upon its journey.</p>

<p>The professor rattles the other door viciously,
and such is his savage fury that he
threatens to demolish the framework. Then
with a roar and a volley of French expletives
he turns to make another rush upon the opposite
end of the car.</p>

<p>In thus turning he finds himself face to face
with a man. The professor heeds him no
more than he would a troublesome fly that
buzzes before his face. His long arms saw the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
air like those of a Dutch windmill, and giving
his wildest whoop he starts to clear a passage
to the other terminus, as though he sees the
open door and means to escape by it.</p>

<p>In so doing he counts without his host, for
Aleck Craig blocks the way. An experienced
boxer, he notes the approach of the wizard
with a feeling of disdain. It is almost like
boy’s play to encounter such an easy mark,
but the safety of those in the car demands
prompt action.</p>

<p>Hence he puts considerable force into the
blow he sends straight from the shoulder.
The professor lands on his back in the middle
of the car, the most surprised man in seven
counties. He does not know what has happened—perhaps
imagines he butted his head
against some projection, and makes a feeble,
bewildered attempt to gain his feet, but
Craig pushes him back to the floor, and deliberately
sits down upon the prostrate form
of the terror.</p>

<p>“Ladies, will one of you kindly close the
door,” he says, and it is Dorothy who does as
he requests, for besides the hooded Sister, still
telling her beads, she is the only one in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
panic-stricken company not uttering little
shrieks and gasps of real or assumed terror.</p>

<p>“There is no longer any danger, ladies. I
beg of you to be calm. Lie still, sir,” giving
the professor, who has made a movement as
if about to rise, a sudden shake, to remind
him that he has met his Waterloo.</p>

<p>Looking up Aleck Craig is conscious of the
fact that he is now the cynosure of admiring
eyes. Coming thus unexpectedly to their
relief, it is but natural that these women
should look upon his manly figure, his
bronzed features, and curly hair with a kindled
interest. What thrills him is the look he sees
upon the face of Samson Cereal’s daughter;
the expression of fear is gone, and in its place
comes one of puzzled conjecture, then a sudden
rosy blush.</p>

<p>Dorothy has recognized him.</p>

</div>

<p class="chaptitle">THE MAN FROM THE BOSPHORUS.</p>


<p>The excitement gradually dies away when
the fair inmates of the car realize that they
are no longer in danger from the crazy professor,
whose brain cannot stand the exhilarating
influence of a ride in mid air.</p>

<p>Slowly the wheel revolves, and relieved of
their apprehensions some of the women proceed
to look out upon the wonderful spectacle,
for Chicago lies spread out before their
vision, bathed in the mystic moonlight, while
at their feet, as it were, nestles the representative
homes of the world’s strangest peoples.</p>

<p>The wheel goes on, and again they mount
upward for the second revolution. Dorothy
all this time has been thinking of other scenes
than those upon which her eyes rest. Before
her vision came the snow-covered sides of
Mount Royal, the icy bosom of the mighty St.
Lawrence, the royal splendor of last winter’s
ice carnival, when the crystal palace was dedicated
in the gay fashion that has been the charm
of a Canadian winter for a long time past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>How distinctly does she remember the frolic
on the long stretch of ice and the adventure
that befell her. No wonder the blood tingles
her veins as she realizes that the courteous
skater who gave her assistance in the hour
of her need is the same who now sits upon
the recumbent form of the panting professor—that
he has performed a feat of valor
that has won for him the title of hero in her
eyes.</p>

<p>She is no prim New England maiden, this
only child of the Chicago grain manipulator.
The warm blood of an Oriental mother flows
in her veins, though she knows it not.
Besides, on the father’s side she inherits some
of his daring.</p>

<p>When she no longer doubts the identity of
the man who has come to their rescue, Dorothy
turns away from the window—though they are
at this time reaching the point over which
all voyagers on the wheel have raved—and
approaches the Canadian, who smiles a little
as he looks up into the fearless dusky
orbs.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir, but unless I am
seriously mistaken I believe I have met you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
before, and under circumstances that left me
your debtor. Am I right?” she asks.</p>

<p>“You refer to our meeting last winter. I
have remembered with pleasure that a broken
strap allowed me to be of some assistance to
you, though deploring the fact that you
received an injury in your fall. Perhaps you
will recollect that you gave me your card. I
called at all the hotels on the following day
but could not find you.”</p>

<p>“Ah! we were stopping with friends,” she
smiles.</p>

<p>“I haunted the pleasure ground, and was
at every affair for days after, hoping to learn
that you had not been seriously injured.”</p>

<p>“A telegram called us home the next day.
Father was ill. But—you had the card—my
address is upon it. If you had been <i>very</i>
solicitous about my health——”</p>

<p>“Ah!” he breaks in, “pardon me again.
That is where the curious part of it comes in.
Look, I have it still. After I left you I continued
skating. Something happened down
the river—perhaps you may have read about
it, but they gave me much more credit than
I deserved. At any rate, I was in the water,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
and, with the assistance of men who brought
boards, managed to save a young lady. The
ice was new at the spot, and hardly fit for use,
though she had no warning. I only mention
this to explain another circumstance. Later
on I remembered your card; when I took it
out of my pocket it had been soaked, and only
half remained legible. Thus I could only discover
that your first name was Dorothy, and
that Chicago claimed you for a resident.”</p>

<p>“How strange,” she murmurs.</p>

<p>“I confess that when I came to the great
Fair, I wondered if by some odd chance I
might see you here, though it would be a
remarkable thing indeed. While I think of
the oddity of our meeting here, I am struck
dumb with amazement,” he says seriously.</p>

<p>“It seems like fate to me,” is what her
heart whispers, and the very thought causes
the blood to mount over neck and face until
Aleck’s eyes are ravished with the fairest
picture they ever beheld.</p>

<p>Love comes at no man’s bidding—it cannot
be bought with the riches of an Eastern potentate—spontaneously
it springs from the heart
as the lightning leaps from cloud to cloud. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
Aleck Craig, bachelor, realizes, as he looks
into the lovely face of Marda’s daughter, that
surely he has met his fate, for such a strange
meeting could not occur unless the cords of
their destiny were bound together.</p>

<p>Dorothy says no more just at present. The
wheel is rolling around, the pinnacle passed,
and they are descending. Soon they must
part. The professor has made several
attempts at rising, but Craig shakes him
down as easily as he might a schoolboy. The
Padarewski of the Ferris wheel is in the
hands of a master-voice and the flail-like arms
have long since ceased to cause the wildest
music ever heard in one of these cars—and
truth to tell strange things have happened
under their shelter, from a wedding in mid air
to the “siss-boom-ah!” of a score of ascending
college students, who deemed themselves
slighted by the superior attractions of the
Midway, and were determined to win notice.</p>

<p>As they near the bottom, Dorothy overcomes
her reserve once more.</p>

<p>“You will think it strange that I should
come to this place at night, and with only a
middle-aged lady for a companion, but I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
a reason for it, Mr. Craig. You know who I
am now—the daughter of Samson Cereal.
We live on the North side. Some time perhaps
you may call, and I might feel it my
duty to explain. God knows it is no idle
whim that brings me here, but a sacred
purpose.”</p>

<p>Her voice is low, her manner earnest, almost
eloquent. The Canadian is deeply moved—when
does a beautiful woman with her soul in
her eyes fail to arouse enthusiasm?</p>

<p>“I can well believe that, Miss Dorothy,
from the few facts I have learned,” he says,
and although her eyebrows are arched in surprise,
she makes no remark.</p>

<p>The wheel has ceased to revolve. Craig
arises, and allows the professor to regain his
feet.</p>

<p>“Are we down?” ejaculates that pious
fraud in anxious tones, and upon his wife reassuring
him that all is well, he says solemnly,
“Thank Heaven for that, and all mercies.”</p>

<p>Dorothy manages to brush close to the
Canadian, and takes occasion to say:</p>

<p>“To-morrow night we receive. Will you
come?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>He looks straight in her eyes as he replies:</p>

<p>“If I am in the flesh, I will.”</p>

<p>Then as she extends her hand, after they
have left the wheel, he takes it reverently in
his.</p>

<p>“Good night, Mr. Craig.”</p>

<p>He watched the two veiled ladies vanish in
the midst of the throng that gathers at this
point, where Persian and Turkish theaters,
with their noisy mouthpieces in front, vie with
the Chinese and Algerian shows further on.</p>

<p>The murmur of her soft voice, the look of
her lovely eyes, remain with him like a
dream, and to himself this stout-hearted
Canadian is saying:</p>

<p>“Hard hit at last, my boy. No more will
the old joys allure you. In the past, peace,
contentment, and all the humors of a jolly
bachelorhood. To come, the fierce longing,
the uneasy rest, the yearning after what may
prove to be the unattainable. Hang it! I’ve
laughed at others, and now they have revenge.
Well, would you change it all—cross out
the experience of to-night?”</p>

<p>“Not for worlds, my boy, and you know
it!” says a voice in his ear, and turning, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
finds the speaker, as he supposes, is Wycherley,
the careless, good-natured Bohemian—half
painter, half actor, and whole vagabond.</p>

<p>“Come, I didn’t suppose there were eavesdroppers
around,” mutters Craig, confused.</p>

<p>“Well, you uttered that last sentence a
trifle louder than you intended, and I answered
it for you. That’s all. No offense
meant, I assure you. Come, walk arm and
arm with me. I feel the eyes of Aroun Scutari
upon me, and want to arrange my plans before
granting him an interview.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, if it will help you.”</p>

<p>“Are you very angry with me, Aleck?”</p>

<p>“Angry? What for?”</p>

<p>“For the miserable business I was engaged
in. I honestly assure you my motives were
really quite philanthropical. At the end you
know I realized what a foolish thing I had
done. You know me well enough, old fellow,
to understand that I’m no villain, fool though
I may be at times.”</p>

<p>His repentance is sincere, and Aleck, like
the good-hearted fellow he is, claps him on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>“I hold no grudge against you, my boy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
On the contrary this ridiculous escapade on
the part of the Turk and yourself has resulted
very pleasantly to a fellow of my size. It
enabled me to meet one for whom I have been
looking six months and more.”</p>

<p>“When you mentioned her name I knew
there was something in the wind. And believe
me, Aleck, you did old Montreal proud. I
wish the Toque Bleue snowshoe boys had
been here to see their bold comrade climb the
Ferris wheel.”</p>

<p>At this Craig laughs merrily.</p>

<p>“They might have believed me a little daft,
for surely such a Quixotic venture could have
but one meaning—that I had thrown my
senses to the winds, and imbibed too much
Chicago champagne.”</p>

<p>“Here comes the Turk straight at me, as if
resolved to wait no longer. Mark his dark
face. He saw you come out of that car. The
deal is up, and I must defy his royal nibs.”</p>

<p>Aroun Scutari has barred their path; one
hand he reaches out and touches Wycherley.</p>

<p>“You deceived me, traitor!” he says, with
a peculiar accent on the words, such as a
foreigner usually gives, no matter how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
thoroughly at home he may be with the
English language.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, you are mistaken; I simply
deceived myself. When the critical moment
came my nerve failed me. That mug of
French cider should have been something
stronger. It is all right, anyway; this gentleman
saved the girls, so what’s the odds?”</p>

<p>His coolness is remarkable. Really Wycherley
must have haunted the Eskimo village a
good deal of late, to show so little concern
with the grave affairs of life.</p>

<p>“It is all wrong. By the beard of the
Prophet, I will look to you! Where is the
money with which I buy your soul?”
demands the Turk, working his hands as
though eager to get them fastened upon the
throat of the Christian dog of an unbeliever.</p>

<p>“What you paid me I used in the regular
routine of my work. By proxy, I saved the
girl. There is now one hundred dollars due.
Will you pony up?” holding out his hand, at
which the furious Moslem glares.</p>

<p>“I do not understand. You make sport
with me, a pasha. If it were Turkey I would
have your head to pay!” he snarls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“Then I am glad it is not Turkey. You
thought you had me molded to your liking,
but the worm has turned. We are quits,
Scutari. <i>Au revoir</i>,” and gayly waving his
hand, the debonnair Swiveller of the Midway
takes Aleck’s arm and saunters on, leaving
the gentleman from the Bosphorus standing
there, his brown face convulsed with the fury
that rends his soul, as he realizes that his
amazing scheme has thus far proved a lamentable
failure.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE ODDITIES OF CAIRO STREET.</p>


<p>Upon the narrow streets of Stamboul a
Turkish pasha may appear a very exalted
personage, and command respect—upon the
Midway Plaisance of the great Chicago
World’s Fair he is quite another character,
and when he speaks his little piece in English,
he may be placed on a par with the itinerant
coffee vender, or the dark-skinned doctor who
sells the queer muffin bread of the Egyptians
in the corner of Cairo Street.</p>

<p>“Let the heathen rage and imagine a vain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
thing,” laughs Wycherley, as he glances
back over his shoulder to see if Scutari is still
shaking a fist after them. His everlasting
good humor is proof against scenes of this
sort—it protects him like a coat of mail.</p>

<p>What he sees causes him a slight spasm of
uneasiness. The pasha still stands there in
front of the theater where the Parisian troupe
of dancers holds forth, but he is no longer
alone, a man with a red fez upon his head is at
his side, and to this individual the Turk talks
in a voluble manner, pointing in the direction
our two acquaintances have gone, as though
he would direct the attention of the other to
them.</p>

<p>Craig has his mind full of the recent surprising
adventure. Even the lively attractions
around him do not serve to divert his thoughts
from Dorothy Cereal and her unknown mission.
Why does she haunt the Midway? He
might imagine many things that perhaps
would not be complimentary to the speculator’s
daughter, but when he remembers her
face he is ready to stake his life that no guile
rests there. Besides, he has not forgotten
what she said so earnestly to him, as if realizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
that it must shock his sense of propriety
to discover a young lady of Chicago’s Four
Hundred wandering, with only a middle-aged
duenna, about the Plaisance, haunting its
strange scenes so assiduously. Why, he can
even remember her exact words, and the
earnest expression of her lovely face will
always haunt him, as she said:</p>

<p>“God knows it is no idle whim that brings
me here, but a sacred purpose.”</p>

<p>Those were her words—he cannot conceive
what their meaning may be, but is ready to
believe in Dorothy.</p>

<p>He has not forgotten the remarkable story
which Wycherley poured into his ears as they
climbed higher and higher in the great Ferris
wheel, and it adds to the piquancy of the occasion
to remember how Samson Cereal, the
grim old wheat operator, the millionaire, won
his bride over in the land of the Golden Horn,
and that Dorothy is the daughter of the lovely
Georgian who had captivated the pasha.</p>

<p>This brings matters to a certain focus. He
is led to believe that the presence of Scutari
has something to do with Dorothy’s mission.
Does she haunt the Midway in order to learn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
from this dark-brown Turkish dealer in precious
stones, the seeming merchant of the gay
bazaar, the secret of her mother? At the
thought Aleck feels a shudder pass through
him, an involuntary shudder, such as would
rack one’s frame upon suddenly discovering
an innocent child fondling a deadly rattlesnake.</p>

<p>To himself he is muttering:</p>

<p>“Thank God, I have been allowed to enter
this singular game—that Heaven may mean
me to be the one who will tear down this
infernal spider web in the Midway; the web
in which this keen old Turk sits and watches
for his fair prey; the web that has been spun
with the sole purpose of snaring the daughter
of the lovely girl old Samson once snatched
from his grasp.”</p>

<p>While thus pondering upon the singular
train of events that have already taken place,
and speculating as to what the near future
may hold in store for him, Aleck feels his
companion’s hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“Come, you must arouse yourself, my boy;
there I’ve been chattering away like a monkey
for five minutes, and you walk along like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
a man in a dream. You need a jolly laugh,
and here’s the doctor to bring it about.”</p>

<p>Looking up Aleck sees the legend:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center bbox">
<span class="smcap">A Street in Cairo.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>He has been there before, several times in
fact, and even the recollection of its boisterous
associations causes a smile to cross his face.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m with you, Wycherley, on condition—ahem—that
you allow me to pay the
fee.”</p>

<p>“Pay nothing. I tell you, my dear fellow,
I’ve made it the rule of my life to deadhead
everywhere. There’s nothing I haven’t seen
in this street of nations, the great Midway,
and all it cost me was a quarter I paid to
watch a Hindoo juggler do some very clever
tricks, and I’m laying my plans to turn the
tables on him. Watch me hoodoo this door-keeper
now.”</p>

<p>With which he steps up. The dark-skinned
boy holds out his hand. Then the
vagabond actor proceeds to make a variety of
gestures, such as a deaf and dumb wretch,
unacquainted with the mute alphabet of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
fellows, might undertake. Aleck is utterly in
the dark as to their meaning, or whether they
have any, but is amazed to see their influence
on the boy. At first he looks disgusted, then
grins, and finally throws up his hands in token
of surrender.</p>

<p>“Come,” says Wycherley, and they enter.</p>

<p>“I say, what in the deuce does all that
mean?” demands the mystified Canadian.</p>

<p>“Oh, my boy! I dare not explain. It is
soul language. I have been initiated into the
Order of Nomads. I’ve eaten salt with them.
That is as far as I can go. There are the
camels. Now to chase the blue devils away.
Nobody can stand here five minutes and fail
to laugh.”</p>

<p>And Wycherley is quite right. The
uncouth figures of the hump-backed animals,
so strange to Western eyes, their meek, docile
aspect, the ridiculous manner of their rising
and squatting are enough in themselves to
arouse interest. Add to this the alarmed
shrieks of the daring women who brave the
merriment of the crowd and venture to take
a ride, the clattering of donkeys with pilgrims
astride of them whose legs almost touch the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
ground, the shouting of donkey boys and
camel drivers, and one can have a faint idea of
the sounds of old Cairo Street.</p>

<p>Several times during the day and evening
the wedding procession takes place; an unique
affair, headed by the stout major-domo, with
whirling sword and fierce expression, who is
followed by the strangest rabble American
eyes ever gazed upon, from the palanquin to
the dancing girls in the rear, their faces half
concealed behind the <i>yashmak</i>.</p>

<p>Looking down the singular street from a
second story balcony, or an upper chamber of
the Mohammedan mosque, as this procession
approaches, one could easily imagine himself
in the old native quarter of Cairo on the Nile.
Aleck speedily forgets his troublesome
thoughts in laughing at the ridiculous sights
presented on all sides.</p>

<p>Cairo Street was better than a doctor. No
one came out regretting having entered.
There you saw only the jolly side of life, for
everyone laughed and joked. While walking
along it was nothing to have a camel poke
his nose over one’s shoulder, or be brushed
aside by a donkey boy on the run, shouting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
“Look out for Mary Anderson!” or “Make
way for Lily Langtry!”</p>

<p>“Will you have your fortune told?” asks
Wycherley, as, mounting the steps of the
mosque, they look through a grated window
into a dimly lighted room where a black
Nubian, with a rather repulsive face, dressed
after the manner of his race, squats upon a rug
and manipulates some sand upon the floor,
spreading it out deftly, tracing certain mystic
symbols, and finally in rapid Arabic delivering
his prophecy to the smiling interpreter who
translates it in the ear of the mulcted victim,
after which “Next,” and another hard-earned
American quarter has started to roll toward
the Nile. This fakir appears to do a flourishing
business—Americans have come to the
Fair to be taken in, and anything connected
with the Orient has a peculiar charm for their
Western eyes.</p>

<p>At the question Craig laughs:</p>

<p>“What! have you a pull with this wonderful
seer in the turban, this ebony prophet from
the land of the lotus?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve been there. If I’d had the
capital I might have been his manager.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
That’s the way it goes—an opportunity of
making myself solid for life lost because I
lacked a few dollars,” and Wycherley
chuckles even while he speaks in such a
dismal strain.</p>

<p>“This fellow isn’t the only fortune teller at
the Fair,” the Canadian says.</p>

<p>“By no means. I know of several others
right here in the street of Cairo.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I remember one at the lower end—a
woman, I believe. I have seen no other.”</p>

<p>“Walk with me. There is one here—they
call her the Veiled Fortune Teller of Cairo
Street. I don’t know that her predictions are
any nearer the truth than the black’s, but
somehow the air of mystery surrounding her
excites a certain amount of curiosity.”</p>

<p>“I would like to see her. I thought I had
exhausted the sights of this street, from the
odd barber shop where they lay one down on
a bench to shave him, to the shoe store where
their stock in trade is yellow and red <i>baboushas</i>
or slippers. If there is a veiled mystery
here I must see her. You said a woman?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and if one can judge of the faint
glimpses seen through the flimsy veil, and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
the shapely figure, a beautiful woman, too.
Let’s see the time—yes, this is her last hour for
receiving to-day. Come along, Aleck, my boy.”</p>

<p>The jovial vagabond almost drags him along,
and presently they bring up in front of a
stuccoed building. Over a doorway is a sign,
so small Aleck does not wonder he missed it,
bearing this scroll:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center bbox">
<span class="smcap">Saidee—the Veiled Fortune Teller.</span><br>
25 cents.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>An Arab boy holds forth, fez and all.</p>

<p>“One <i>half-duro</i>—a quarter each,” he insists,
and Aleck is about to comply when the
eccentric actor steps in front and proceeds to
mesmerize the youth.</p>

<p>“Ten cents,” he mutters feebly, but Claude
only increases his mysterious passes, and at
length the Arab youth throws up the sponge.</p>

<p>“Great is Allah, and Mohammed is his
prophet. Enter <i>taleb</i>, I beg,” he says hastily,
as if desirous of being rid of an incubus.</p>

<p>So they pass in, Aleck Craig never dreaming
what an influence this accidental discovery
of a new curiosity will have upon his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
future. A dozen persons are in the room, and
one by one they interview the veiled woman
on the little stage, who looks into the palm
and reads both the past and the future.</p>

<p>“Look!” says Wycherley quickly; “don’t
you recognize the man seated there?”</p>

<p>“Jove! it’s the pasha himself. Do you
suppose our being here has anything to do
with his presence?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. He was here when we came,
and I know the man well enough to understand
that he has some motive for his visit.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s watch the game.”</p>

<p>“Nothing pleases me better. Notice the
fortune teller, Aleck; did I speak correctly?”</p>

<p>“As near as I can say—yes, I should judge
that she is a fine looking woman, and, like the
most of her sex, a coquette.”</p>

<p>“Oh, why not say <i>all</i>?” smiles Wycherley,
giving him a sly dig in the ribs.</p>

<p>“You know there are exceptions to every
rule, my dear boy. Since we are under the
enchantment of this unknown Circe, let us act
as though we believed in the rubbish and have
our fortunes told.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve done that before. She predicted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
that I would win much gold, but that it could
never stick to my fingers. Think of that.
There’s the cool million to-morrow—perhaps
she means that—and I reckon she’s right
about it not sticking, for how can a man hold
that which he hath not.”</p>

<p>“There goes the pasha up.”</p>

<p>“Now keep your eyes open.”</p>

<p>“She does not seem to have noticed him
before. See how she starts and draws back
as though a sudden fear had penetrated her
heart.”</p>

<p>“Right you are. I believe she has recognized
him.”</p>

<p>“And he?”</p>

<p>“His actions indicate that on his part he
entertains a suspicion, which he is bound to
verify. Now he speaks to her. I would that
I knew Arabic, that I might translate what he
says. My early education was somewhat
neglected in that respect. She replies in a low
tone—I swear her voice trembles with fear.
Why should she dread this man? Tell me that.”</p>

<p>“I cannot say. Wait, and we may learn
something that will give us an insight. I am
deeply interested in all he does.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>“Of course,” says Wycherley, chuckling;
“because you are concerned about Dorothy’s
fortunes. Now the Turk holds out his hand.
She takes it. See his bold eyes, they are
glued upon her face. The gauzy veil tantalizes
Aroun Scutari. I’ve a notion he has
come here to-night to settle some doubt, some
uncertainty, that has preyed upon him for a
long time, and he’ll do it in his own impulsive
autocratic way. There! What did I say,
Aleck?”</p>

<p>There is a sudden movement on the part
of the pasha, a feminine shriek, and Aroun
Scutari stands there with the gauzy veil in his
hand, stands there glaring upon the beautiful
face his rude action has unveiled. Immediately
the lights are extinguished, and all is
darkness. Confusion follows.</p>

<p>“Come, let us get out of this!” cries vagabond
Claude, and Aleck Craig allows himself
to be led into the street of Cairo.</p>

<p>He is silent and has suffered a terrible shock,
for when that veil was torn away his astounded
gaze fell upon a face that has haunted his
dreams these six months, and he could swear
he looked upon the features of Dorothy!</p>

</div>

<p class="chaptitle">CRAIG BUILDS A THEORY.</p>


<p>The idea seems too preposterous to be entertained
for a moment, and yet he must give
some credence to what his eyes have seen.
Besides, the strange presence of Dorothy in
the Midway is as yet unexplained, though
she has, particularly, promised to enlighten
him on the following evening, if he will
call.</p>

<p>Craig is sorely puzzled. Many things flash
into his mind and confuse him. Perhaps,
after all, he might have been mistaken. Why
has not Wycherley made some comment upon
the matter? So the Bachelor of the Midway,
as the actor has, in a spirit of humor, dubbed
his athletic companion, when learning how the
Canadian has persistently haunted the region
of world’s fakes and curiosities, turns now to
that party.</p>

<p>“That was something not down on the bills,
I’m thinking, Claude,” he remarks.</p>

<p>“I’m puzzling my head over the cause of it
all. The pasha was in deadly earnest. Don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
imagine that it was a set-up game to clear the
room. What did he expect to see?”</p>

<p>“Probably he suspected that someone he
knew was playing a joke on him,” says Aleck
quietly.</p>

<p>“Humph! he was a bear then,” grunts the
other.</p>

<p>“By the way, my dear boy, did she remind
you of—well, anyone you had seen before?”</p>

<p>“That’s what makes me mad. A chump in
the seat in front got his beastly head between
me and the stage, so that I couldn’t see her
face. You saw me knock his hat down over
his ears. Well, just then the lights went out
and I missed the opportunity of solving the
riddle of the mysterious veiled prophetess of
Cairo Street.”</p>

<p>It is Aleck’s turn to grunt now.</p>

<p>“Was she very beautiful, Craig?”</p>

<p>“Yes, strikingly so. I wish you had seen
her. Never mind, did the pasha come out?”</p>

<p>“Rather! he was ahead of us. Perhaps he
feared the consequences of his bold act, for
these people of the Orient are quick to use
knife or yataghan. As he passed I heard him
laugh, and, as it is seldom these Turks do that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
I can guess he was well pleased over what he
had done, and that he recognized the face
from which he snatched the veil.”</p>

<p>If ever a sorely puzzled man walked up or
down that singular narrow street, our bachelor
is the individual. He cudgels his brains for a
solution to the enigma and finds it not.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how I can wait until to-morrow
night to solve the problem,” he mutters.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demands Wycherley
quickly. “Is it so bad as to keep you from
sleeping? Aleck, my poor fellow, I pity you.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! I’m bothering my head over
quite another thing. In fact, I’ve a nut to
crack that threatens to do me up. Pardon,
old boy, but I’ve been thinking of the story
you told me.”</p>

<p>“You mean about old Samson; of course
you are deeply interested now—that’s natural.
To the best of my belief he’s a millionaire and
better—lives in grand style on the lake shore.
I walked past the house several times, because,
you see, I wanted to understand how the land
lay, if I was to be a prospective son-in-law—ha,
ha. All dreams knocked in the head now,
I assure you, dear boy. I shall feel at liberty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
to throw a kiss to the pretty girl in the cigar
stand. My bonds are gone, the shackles
loosened, and Claude Wycherley is again a
free man.”</p>

<p>An odd genius this, assuredly. Aleck can
never edge a word in so long as his flow of
breath lasts, so he usually holds his peace
until the actor pauses.</p>

<p>“I want to ask you a few questions,” he
says.</p>

<p>“A thousand, if you wish. I would do anything
for you, Aleck. Again you have saved
my life.”</p>

<p>“How?” demands the Canadian.</p>

<p>“Only for you I should perhaps have been
fool enough to have attempted that climb on
the wheel. I am in poor condition to-night,
and ten to one I would have lost my grit and
my grip. Then they’d have swept me up below,
and poor Wycherley would have been a
bursted bubble, a back number. So I feel
awfully grateful to you. Ask me any favor
and I’ll put myself out to do it—anything but
giving you a tip on the market. That’s a dead
secret yet—my plans are not quite perfected.
If I win that million now——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>“Hang the million! What I want to know
concerns that part of your story in which the
Chicagoan brought his Georgian wife—stolen
from the Turkish pasha—to this place.”</p>

<p>“All right. What I know is at your service.
As I learned it from his royal nibs, Scutari, of
course I’m in the dark wherever he is.”</p>

<p>“I realize that,” returns Aleck slowly;
“but perhaps I may unearth some fact that
will help me to solve this question. You told
me the lovely Marda died a year or so after
reaching Chicago.”</p>

<p>“So Scutari said and swore to.”</p>

<p>“Yet the daughter knows nothing concerning
her mother. Why should Samson Cereal
desire to keep the facts from her if there was
nothing to conceal?”</p>

<p>“Look here, you’re probing this thing like a
lawyer. You go beyond me. I deal in facts,
and never worry about the reasons back of
them. What are you getting at—didn’t
Marda die?”</p>

<p>“Ah! that is what I am unable to say. It
is a secret that perhaps only Samson Cereal
could explain. As to myself, without any
positive proof to back my theory up, I have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
notion that all these years the old manipulator
of wheat has deceived his daughter.”</p>

<p>“Confusion! I say, you strike hard,
Cannuck.”</p>

<p>“That Marda is not dead.”</p>

<p>“Bless me! what puts such a strange notion
into your head, my <i>dear</i> fellow?”</p>

<p>“I believe I have seen her.”</p>

<p>Craig smokes his cigar while delivering
these sledge-hammer blows. He really enjoys
the astonishment of his companion, for generally
Wycherley is proof against such assault.</p>

<p>“The plot thickens. It was a great hour
when I ran across you, Aleck Craig. When
do you think you saw Samson’s Georgian
wife, and where?”</p>

<p>“In this street of Cairo, to-night. Plainly,
Claude, that was why I was so anxious to
learn if you had seen the face of the fortune
teller.”</p>

<p>At this the nomad assumes an attitude that
is a revelation concerning his ability as an
actor. Strange that the world failed to properly
appreciate him.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! you don’t mean it—and the
pasha—— Why, I’m already half convinced.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
He suspected—but see here, how could it be
that Marda living would appear dead all these
years? Incredible!”</p>

<p>“I admit it seems so, and yet perhaps if we
knew what Samson Cereal knows, deep down
in his heart, we might find it easier to believe.
It is a matter of speculation with me, but if
you stop and think for a moment you can
understand how difficult it would be for happiness
to follow such a marriage—he, a progressive
American with all the ideas we claim, she
born and reared under the blighting influence
of Eastern customs. I can readily imagine a
quarrel arising and she fleeing back to the
sunny land of her birth.”</p>

<p>“What! leaving her child behind?”</p>

<p>“Quite likely. This is theory. When I
learn some facts we can see how near I was to
being right.”</p>

<p>“Well, continue the theory: why does she
come to the land of ice again—the country
from which she fled years and years ago?”</p>

<p>Aleck shrugs his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Ask me something easy. Put the question
to one of the Sandwich Islanders or a
Hottentot. Perhaps she has been drawn by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
the mother love to see her child again, for
that affection is not confined to any class.
The lioness will fight for her whelps. Putting
speculation aside, Claude, I am ready to swear
that the face of this veiled prophetess was
very like that of Dorothy. I was struck
dumb by the resemblance. At first I had a
positive notion it was she. Then I gradually
realized that such a thing was too improbable,
and while we walked along my mind evolved
the theory which I have given you.”</p>

<p>“Would that have any bearing on the presence
of Dorothy here?” asks Wycherley,
stopping to light his pipe at the gas jet of a
tobacconist, and nodding familiarly to the
Greek in charge.</p>

<p>“It might. She told me her mission was a
sacred one, and what could be more in keeping
with such a word than the search of a
child for her mother? However, we may be
meddling with what does not concern us,
though fortune has apparently decreed that I
should be interested in the fortunes of Dorothy
Cereal, judging from our several peculiar
meetings. Have you any other plans for
to-night, comrade?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“I never leave here until closing time.
Can’t explain it, but there’s a charm about
this same old Midway that is life to me. You
know my nature, Craig, and it just chimes
with such a kaleidoscopic scene as this, color,
music, and laughter—not a tear or a frown.
Heigho! when the curtain rings down and the
bugle sounds 'lights out,’ I shall have to
seek consolation in making love to that black-eyed
Spanish cigar girl, or emigrate with all
these Turks, Arabs, and Moors.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="chaptitle">A BACHELOR PROTECTORATE.</p>


<p>Craig has himself seen enough of the daily
life along the Midway to feel some sympathy
for his companion, whose doleful refrain has
at least the merit of sincerity.</p>

<p>The popularity of the Midway was something
of a joke during the life of the Fair, but
never questioned. It is since the close of the
great Exposition that the people of this country
have gradually awakened to the fact that
as a congress of nations, this Plaisance was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
the most successful thing ever planned and
executed.</p>

<p>Everyone has pleasant memories of hours
spent in strolling up and down, of queer
sights witnessed, and, perhaps, singular adventures
in connection with these people from
the four quarters of the earth.</p>

<p>In every prominent city of the land these
memories have been kept alive by a series of
entertainments, representing the Midway in
the height of its glory; breezy items can be
found in the papers, describing the wonders of
the world’s highway, and many snatches of
glowing rhetoric attest to the pleasure derived
by the writer in the scenes on the
Plaisance. In defense of Wycherley, who
haunted these scenes until he loved them as a
Parisian is devoted to his city, it may not be
out of place to reproduce one of these items
which appeared recently in a prominent
Western paper:</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“It was not until about July 1 that the
denizens of the merry Midway got their houses
and shops in order, and settled down to business.
They easily made up for lost time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
however, and during the four bright happy
months that followed, the famous street was
far and away the principal popular attraction
of the Fair. Those who went to spend the
whole day at the Exposition, equipped with
lunch, camp chair, and guidebook, usually
turned up in the Plaisance about every two
hours. Others who made briefer visits to the
park either began or ended them in the same
attractive quarter. School teachers, who
made out their programme for the educational
features in the Liberal Arts building, generally
landed in Cairo Street. Students of sculpture
who went with the best intentions of studying
the marble models in the Art Palace, ended by
studying living models in the Moorish Palace.
Ministers who hoped to prepare themselves
for missionary work, were easily persuaded
that they would be best equipped by looking
over the Dahomeyans and South Sea Islanders.
And as to young America—well, the day for
him was not done till he had tossed off half a
dozen or more bumpers of beer in Old Vienna.</p>

<p>“All this is now a memory. The places
that knew these merry parties shall know
them no more forever. The Samoan now sits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
serenely under his island palm; the Bedouin
is again astride his steed, and with shaded
eyes looks off across the desert; the Egyptian
'neath the shadow of the mighty pyramids,
recounts the marvels of his half year in the
New World; and the sad-eyed Cingalese
woman tells her sisters in 'the gorgeous
East’ about the wondrous West; while the
American, whose energy and genius reared it
all, now sees those sights through a darkened
glass, and faintly hears the once familiar
sounds, muffled and indistinct, as of a distant
troop of boys at play. He goes plodding on
in paths of busy commerce, farther and farther
along, till time and distance intervene, and
Midway sights grow dimmer still, and Midway
sounds sink to a whisper.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>These then are the feelings that cause the
Thespian such sorrow. He hates to think
that before snow flies this gay scene will have
vanished as a dream, never to be seen again.</p>

<p>“Cheer up, my dear fellow,” says Aleck,
“there will be other fairs as great as this.”</p>

<p>“But never again a Midway. However, let
us throw dull care to the winds. It ill becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
us to mourn, we who are butterflies of
the hour. What would you now, my lord?”</p>

<p>Wycherley smiles again—the passing of his
grief has been very rapid—for his nature is
buoyant.</p>

<p>“I have no plans. We can move around
until it is time to go. I am impressing this
scene on my mind so that at any future day I
may reproduce it by simply closing my eyes.
When before now, on American soil, could you
see such groups as that sauntering along?”
nodding in the direction of a squad of
Algerians and Moors walking past, clad in the
turban and caftan, burnoose and colored robes
of their class, with the inevitable heavy slippers
on their feet.</p>

<p>Close behind come a trio of Celestials chattering
like parrots, while in sight at the same
time are one or more natives of India, Dahomey,
and Lapland, representing the antipodes.
It is the bringing together of people who live
at the frozen north, and those from the burning
equator; the exposition of their home
life, their peculiar habits, their war customs,
and marriage ceremonies, that lends such a
charm to a gathering like this. Contrast it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
by a visit to the Liberal Arts building and see
what civilization does for the human family,
what wonderful treasures are within the grasp
of everyone who lives to-day in an enlightened
community.</p>

<p>Just as the squad of Moors and Algerians
move past in their sauntering way, Wycherley
is heard to utter an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Who would have believed it?” he says.</p>

<p>“What now?” asks Aleck, wondering
if his companion is dreaming of the fortune
he is to win or lose on the morrow.</p>

<p>“She is a flirt, I do believe,” continues the
actor.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s the dark-eyed Spanish senorita who
worries the boy. Never mind; remember there’s
as good fish in the sea as ever were caught.”</p>

<p>“You’re a Job’s comforter, Aleck. Under
the circumstances, physician, heal thyself,”
retorts the other.</p>

<p>“Eh? What now?”</p>

<p>“It chances to be the young woman in
whom you have such a deep interest.”</p>

<p>At this Craig becomes all attention.</p>

<p>“You mean Dorothy—where is she?” he
demands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“Hush! not quite so loud, my boy. Glance
over yonder, she is just going into the
Japanese bazaar.”</p>

<p>As Craig looks he receives a shock. The
brilliant lights fall upon a face he cannot forget
and which is just being covered by the
light veil attached to her hat. Dorothy it is,
the millionaire’s daughter. His interest is
quickly aroused, and under the circumstances
it is not at all strange that he should desire to
see who her male companion may be.</p>

<p>They are conversing eagerly, as though
deeply interested in each other. Another
moment and the bazaar has closed upon them.</p>

<p>“Let us follow,” suggests Wycherley, at once.</p>

<p>Aleck hesitates.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that it would be just the
thing,” he says doubtfully, but the other
gives a scoffing laugh.</p>

<p>“Tell that to the marines. You want to go—you
have a deep interest in this young lady,
and it is but natural you should want to see
who her companion is. Come.”</p>

<p>The temptation is irresistible.</p>

<p>“I can buy another cane, at any rate,” he
mutters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>“How many have you got now?” asks
Wycherley.</p>

<p>“Two dozen or more. It’s a fad of mine,
you see.”</p>

<p>They enter the bazaar, which, if not a very
spacious building, is at least well-stocked, and
usually crowded with sight-seers or purchasers.
Aleck endeavors to keep at a distance
from the pair whose entrance has
inspired their action, at the same time he
manages to direct numerous glances at the
gentleman in question.</p>

<p>“Well, what d’ye make of him?” asks
Wycherley.</p>

<p>“I am favorably impressed with his looks,”
is the frank response that causes a low whistle
of surprise to leave the actor’s lips.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be hanged! In confidence between
us, my dear fellow, I quite agree with
you. Looks like an independent young chap.
There’s something about his style, his bronzed
face and hands, the soft hat he wears, and his
general get-up, that suggests the miner to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, it didn’t occur to me before, but
now that you mention it I can see the same
thing. What it means, I am at a loss to say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>“See how fondly she clings to him.”</p>

<p>“Claude, you are cruel.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, my dear boy. Follow my example.
When I found my cake was dough, I
gave her up without a struggle. That’s
diplomacy in love matters. I learned it long
ago, on the stage. Go thou and do likewise.
Seriously, I reckon you haven’t the ghost of
a show there, so be philosophical, my merry
bachelor, and take things as they come. As
for myself, I’m trying to place this gentleman;
something about his face seems familiar. It
may be I’ve noticed him on the Midway at
some time.”</p>

<p>Aleck buys his cane, and continues to keep
a good distance between the couple and himself.
They are simply looking at the curios
displayed by the cunning Japs, and appear to
be more engrossed with each other than the
objects around. All of which causes our
bachelor the most peculiar sensations of his
life.</p>

<p>At one moment he has firmly resolved that
he will not seek the presence of this fair one on
the succeeding night, and immediately he has
bitter reflections, of which he is ashamed later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
on, reflections that bear upon Dorothy in the
sense of her mother being brought up in the
peculiar tenets of Oriental life, which in a
measure may have descended to the daughter.</p>

<p>Again his mind undergoes a change, and he
scores himself for such a thought. He remembers
the face first seen under the wintry sky
of Canada, and again on the Ferris wheel of
the Midway; remembers that she claimed her
mission to be a sacred one, and until further
proof to the contrary is brought he must
believe in her innocence.</p>

<p>What if this is some lover who has incurred
the parental anger, and whom she dares not
receive at home—he has the face and bearing
of a true man.</p>

<p>“Don’t imagine you have a mortgage on
her affection, Aleck Craig,” he mutters sneeringly,
as if to mock the strange feeling of pain
that assails his heart; “and it's none of your
business if by chance she has met her fate
before discovering that a bachelor of your
size was haunting the Fair looking for her.
Well, perhaps I may strike up an acquaintance
with this young fellow, and, confound it—be
a brother to her yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>“I thought it would happen. I looked for
just that same thing to occur,” breaks in
Wycherley, in a thrilling stage whisper.</p>

<p>“What now?” asks Craig guiltily, fearing
he has again been talking indiscreetly above
his breath.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute! Examine these elegant
tablecloths worked with silk; aint they
beauties? Now, the coast of Bohemia is
clear.”</p>

<p>Aleck of course turns his head quickly to
see who has caused such commotion in the
mind of his companion, and Wycherley
watches the face of the Canadian, well knowing
it will be an index to his feelings. A
figure is moving down the aisle—a woman
dressed attractively, but heavily veiled. As
soon as Aleck’s eyes fall upon her graceful
form, he is struck with the peculiar charm of
her person, and the actor seeing this bends
over to say:</p>

<p>“I see, you, too, have guessed her identity.
It is the Veiled Fortune Teller of Cairo Street—and
yonder is Dorothy. Perhaps the strange
events of this remarkable night are not yet
concluded, my dear boy.”</p>

<p class="chaptitle">NEWS FROM COLORADO.</p>


<p>Wycherley is right; Aleck has recognized
the cloaked figure. There is some undefinable
quality about her carriage that betrays her—a
gliding movement, so totally unlike the action
of an American. What adds power to the
suspicion is the fact that she seems to follow
the couple whose movements Aleck and his
companion have been watching.</p>

<p>“I feel as though some sort of crisis were
approaching, Claude. Now do you suppose
she suspects what manner of face that veil
hides?” he asks his friend.</p>

<p>“Oh, as to that, Dorothy has thrown back
the veil impatiently a dozen times in order to
look at some curio, but, being bothered with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
the bold glances her beauty draws from some
of the visitors here, lets it drop again. If this
be Marda, as you seem to imagine, depend on
it, she has seen the girl’s face.”</p>

<p>“What will she do?”</p>

<p>“Ah! there I must confess my weakness.
We might consult the black Nubian who
holds forth in that sacred chamber of the
mosque.”</p>

<p>“To the deuce with him and his folly. I
imagine we can get a better answer by watching
these people, though, in one way, it goes
against my grain to play the detective.”</p>

<p>“Bah! you’re too conscientious. Remember,
we are not mere curiosity mongers, nor
reporters seeking a sensation, but sworn protectors
to this lovely Hebe, who lacks a
brother’s care. Under such circumstances,
Aleck, anything is fair in love or war.”</p>

<p>“Be it so. I must accept your version, and
stifle my dislike to the task by remembering
the demands of duty.”</p>

<p>“Bravo! you’ll get there yet. They are
quitting the bazaar, and she is close behind.
Now watch me play a little side game.”</p>

<p>In an instant Wycherley has managed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
to pass around a table and meet the cloaked
and veiled figure at the doorway. The execution
of the maneuver is first-class. A bent
pin or some such object in the lapel of his
coat catches the floating veil, and for the
second time inside an hour the Cairo Street fortune
teller finds herself shorn of the gauzy covering
that has been used to screen her features.</p>

<p>“I really beg pardon! too awkward of me,
to be sure. You—why, can it be Miss
Dorothy Cereal?” says the vagabond, with a
look of well-simulated surprise.</p>

<p>The other hastily replaces the veil, but not
before he notices the alarm and perturbation
his pretended recognition has caused.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she mutters wildly; “it is one
mistake, sir. I assure you.”</p>

<p>Then she darts out of the bazaar door like a
frightened deer. Wycherley laughs softly to
himself at his success.</p>

<p>“What do you think, now?” he asks of
Aleck, who joins him outside.</p>

<p>“There can be no mistake about her identity.
We have yet to learn whether this can
be the Marda of the past, the mother whom
Dorothy has been taught to believe dead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>“I believe I have settled even that,” declares
the actor. “Come, let us continue to
keep them in sight while we talk.”</p>

<p>“You said something to her as you bowed
with the grace of a Chesterfield. I was not
near enough to hear what it was.”</p>

<p>“But you noticed her confusion?”</p>

<p>“It was very apparent.”</p>

<p>“I pretended to believe it was Miss Cereal,
and addressed her by that name.”</p>

<p>“Jove! and she——”</p>

<p>“Denied it with a trembling voice and great
earnestness. I have known all along she was
a foreigner from the quaint way she had of
expressing herself in English. Upon my word
I am more and more inclined to believe your
remarkable theory to be true.”</p>

<p>So they saunter along, keeping a safe distance
behind, yet close enough to see all that
occurs. The two in front talk together in low
tones such as would befit lovers. More than
once Aleck finds a bitter feeling taking root in
his heart, and it is only through severe measures
that he is able to crush it. A new experience
is being forced upon him, and when
he realizes how his work of the early night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
must go for naught if there is another Richmond
in the field, he smiles in the grim way
some men have when inflicting torture upon
themselves. He could not look more rigid
and contemptuous were he holding a red-hot
iron to his flesh and searing the fang-marks
left by a mad dog.</p>

<p>As for Wycherley, that merry rascal appreciates
the situation—and though incapable of
experiencing the same sensations that creep
over Aleck, he knows what it means. In his
accustomed way he jokes about it.</p>

<p>“Feel like you’re marching to your own
funeral, eh, Craig? Never mind, you can
still be a brother to her. Great institution
that. To my personal knowledge I occupy
that delightful place of uncertainty to a dozen
dainty despots here and abroad. I am connected,
as it were, by ties of consanguinity to
nearly every city of first importance in the
world. Oh, take a veteran’s advice, my dear
boy, and let no such little trouble disconcert
you. A merry life—to enjoy pleasure as she
flies—that’s my motto, and sad will be the day
when I part from it.”</p>

<p>There are grains of sound philosophy in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
much that this strange genius says, if one can
only separate the wheat from the chaff. Craig
hears as in a dream, for his mind is upon
those ahead. Shall he continue this espionage?
Is it right? Where is the middle-aged
duenna who was with Dorothy earlier in the
evening? He knows she is secretly in the pay
of the plotting pasha, but the young girl must
as yet be ignorant of this fact. Perhaps she
has left the other at a certain place, where she
may be found later.</p>

<p>It is growing late.</p>

<p>By degrees even the Midway is thinning
out, for people know the horrors awaiting them
in the grand crush for accommodations on the
street cars, and are urged to hurry on this account,
though none of them ever escape the jam.</p>

<p>While passing the large building where the
Tyrolese warblers invite the passers-by to gaze
upon the cyclorama of the Alps, some impulse
causes the couple ahead to enter, and the
veiled woman, as if led by an attraction she
cannot resist, follows.</p>

<p>“Let us wait here. They must come out
by this door,” says Craig, glad of a chance to
consider the matter in its several bearings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>Presently he becomes aware of the fact that
Wycherley is shaking hands with a gentleman
and indulging in a chat. Their voices
are deadened by the many sounds of the Midway,
which never quiets down until midnight,
but when he glances toward them a few
minutes later, Aleck can see from the dramatic
gestures of his friend that the vagabond
Thespian has received information on some
score that excites him, but the rapid thoughts
crowding upon his brain prohibit his taking
any interest in what they may be gossiping
over. He takes a second look at the man,
however, and upon seeing his style, somehow
inclines toward the belief that whoever he
may be he comes out of the rowdy West. His
laugh is like the roar of a bull, and his voice
reminds one of a storm muttering in the
Rockies, it is so deep and bass.</p>

<p>Craig begins to gather the several threads
of his opinions together, just as the driver of
a four-in-hand might secure the various reins,
in order to make a clean run. He is making
fair headway when an interruption occurs, and
frowning, Aleck looks up to see the jocund
actor at his side, having the unknown in tow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>“My friend, Bob Rocket—Aleck Craig.
Two good fellows who should know each
other,” says Wycherley, and the Canadian
feeling his hand caught as in a vise, realizes
that his comrade has betrayed him, and is in
duty bound to return the grip.</p>

<p>“Glad to meet you, Mr. Craig. Had a
chum by your name once, poor fellow.”</p>

<p>“Ah! something happened to him, then?”
Aleck is interested enough to remark.</p>

<p>“Hoss thieves—Mexicans—shot the poor
boy. I made ’em sweat, you understand.
There was no rest for me till that score was
wiped out,” returns the ruddy faced man,
gritting his strong teeth, and with a strange
light flashing in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I judge you are from the West, Mr.
Rocket.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Colorado is my roost at present. I
was born on the border and brought up among
the wildest scenes a man ever looked on. In
Mexico I’ve been with the revolutionists. I’ve
mined in Idaho and Montana, and been peace
officer in a dozen Territories and States. At
present I’m a sheriff in Colorado.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! You know my friend here.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
Where did you ever run across this rolling
stone?”</p>

<p>The sheriff’s face suddenly grows soft, as he
turns his head upon Wycherley, and there is
unassumed tenderness in his voice as he says:</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, sir. It was several years
back, that terrible winter we had in Colorado.
I had hard luck and came near passing in my
checks on account of a gunshot wound received
while arresting a desperado—but I got
him, and he stretched hemp, I’m telling you.</p>

<p>“Things went wrong at home, and my
mother and little sister were nigh starved. As
soon as I could travel I went to Denver and
found that only for the kindness of a man
who had a room in the same tenement, and
who was constitutionally dead broke, they
would have given up the ghost. He had spent
every cent he could lay hold of on them,
strangers as they were. That man was Claude
Wycherley, the actor. Do you wonder I love
him like a brother?”</p>

<p>“Come, come, you make me blush. What I
did pleased me. God knows I couldn’t have
followed any other course. Say no more
about it,” cries the vagabond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>“You are doing the Fair, I presume?” remarks
Craig, glad to hear such a good report
of one who hides his light under a bushel.</p>

<p>The sheriff and Claude exchange glances.</p>

<p>“Yes; I may say I have taken it in, but only
as a secondary consideration.”</p>

<p>“Come, I like that. Better not let a Chicagoan
hear such a remark. They are very
sensitive. I have no doubt Colorado could
have done better, but——”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mistake me, Mr. Craig. I meant
that as I was here to look for a man, I had to
give much of my time to the search, and, therefore,
what I have seen of the Fair has been, as
you might say, on the sly,” returns the sheriff,
whose manner lacks the ease of a polished
gentleman.</p>

<p>“And have you met with any success?”</p>

<p>“I have located him at last. He is in
yonder building. A clever and a daring fellow.
He made way with fifty thousand
dollars belonging to the Hecla Mining Company,
of which this same John Phœnix was
treasurer. The president and manager of the
company, probably as wealthy a man as
Colorado boasts, though a stranger to me, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
away, but in his absence the directors wired
me to start after Phœnix, and said a photograph
of him would be sent to me in Chicago.
When it arrived I set to work, and gradually
ran the fellow down. Would you believe me,
he actually had the brass to take the president’s
name. Yes, at a small hotel I found
him registered as John Atherton, and putting
on all the airs of a substantial mine king.
I didn’t take him in at once—some little
legal affair to comply with, you understand.
Besides, I wanted to learn something about
him, so I wired my employers and ever since
I’ve just kept an eye on Phœnix while waiting
for an answer.”</p>

<p>Craig is interested in the narrative, because,
being a man who has seen something of life,
he appreciates such a dramatic situation.</p>

<p>“You are fortunate then, Mr. Rocket,” he
says.</p>

<p>“I mention these facts to you because you
see, Claude, here, says you’re interested in
the young fellow,” continues the Colorado
sheriff.</p>

<p>“I? Impossible!” exclaims Aleck, glancing
from his friend to the man from the West.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes you are! Show him the photo,
Bob.”</p>

<p>Whereupon the sheriff takes out a cardboard
and hands it over to the Canadian. It
is somewhat battered from lying in the pocket
of the officer, but the picture is plainly seen,
and Craig holds his breath with sudden awe as
the electric lights fall upon the features of the
young miner whom he saw in the company of
Dorothy.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p class="chaptitle">THE VENGEANCE THAT SLUMBERED TWENTY
YEARS.</p>


<p>Craig makes no remark, but hands the picture
back. Somehow, instead of feeling exultant
over the fall of a possible rival, his
thoughts are wholly of Dorothy. It looks as
if she must soon receive a terrible blow, and
he feels sad.</p>

<p>“Sorry if he’s a friend of yours, Mr. Craig,
but business is business.”</p>

<p>“Never saw the young man before half an
hour ago. I only take an interest in him
because he is with Samson Cereal’s daughter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“Ah! that charming young woman is a
child of the shrewd old speculator, eh?”</p>

<p>“I trust you may not feel it your duty to
arrest him while in her company. It would
be a terrible shock,” continued Aleck.</p>

<p>The sheriff manages to exchange a sly wink
with Wycherley, as if to declare that he can
see through a mill stone with a hole in it.</p>

<p>“Probably not, Mr. Craig. At least, I hope
such will not be the case. When my telegram
arrives, I am bound to let as little time
as possible slip through my hands before
making sure of my man. In all my experience—and
it’s been considerable, let me tell
you, young fellow—I’ve found that these quiet
chaps are the most to be feared, the most
tricky.”</p>

<p>“I don’t question it,” remarks Aleck, who
seems disinclined to further conversation, and
leaves the others to chat upon various topics,
while he wrestles with the momentous question
that has such a bearing on his life.</p>

<p>Thus time passes.</p>

<p>Those in the cyclorama building begin to
pour forth, having feasted their eyes upon the
glories of the Alps. Among them comes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
couple whose actions have interested our
friends.</p>

<p>Sauntering behind they are not noticed in
the throng heading for the exit.</p>

<p>“Look,” says Wycherley, “they are three;
it is the middle-aged duenna again. She sold
herself to the pasha. Dorothy leans on a
broken rod when she puts any faith in
her.”</p>

<p>That is one of the problems Craig is trying
to solve. He feels that Dorothy should know
the truth, and yet hardly cares to be the one
to tell her. If he lets it go until the succeeding
night that may be too late. What would
he not give for a favorable opportunity.</p>

<p>“They separate; he has business back in
the Fair grounds. Stand here and watch,”
says the Colorado officer, suddenly turning
them into a place of shadow, which he is easily
able to do, as he walks between Craig and the
actor with arms locked.</p>

<p>It is as he says. John Phœnix is bidding
the young girl good-night. Aleck gnaws his
mustache a little nervously as he watches
them, just as though a sudden fear has burst
into his bachelor heart lest the good-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
scamp may take Dorothy in his arms with a
bold lover’s right.</p>

<p>Nothing of the sort occurs, however. He
takes her hand and says something that
causes Dorothy to hang her head, but as to
the nature of her emotion the Canadian is
utterly in the dark. While he is musing
Phœnix is gone.</p>

<p>Upon turning his head Aleck discovers that
Bob Rocket has also disappeared. The man
from Colorado does not mean to allow any
chance to slip through his fingers. All he
awaits is the receipt of a telegram.</p>

<p>The two women have not yet gone on, but
stand where Phœnix has left them. Can it be
possible they wait for his return? Craig
chances to look beyond and catches a glimpse
of a figure there, a figure he knows. It is the
fortune teller of Cairo Street, who hovers near
by, as though eager to approach Dorothy, yet
restrained by a fear lest the girl should
repulse her. Thus, in the agony of doubt she
reaps the sad harvest of the past.</p>

<p>It is an open question whether the women
have seen or paid the least attention to this
figure in black that hovers near by, just as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
a poor moth flutters around a candle that will
singe its bright wings.</p>

<p>They talk together and as Aleck observes
closer, he becomes assured that something
else claims their attention, something that
lies between them and the exit.</p>

<p>Before he can discover what this can be, his
companion says in a surprised tone:</p>

<p>“Why, there’s the Turk—the pasha.”</p>

<p>“That explains it. She has discovered him
in her way, too late to call Phœnix back, and
is now trying to convince her companion that
they had better seek another exit,” Aleck
says hastily.</p>

<p>“And as the woman is in the employ of the
Turk, as this very affair has all been arranged
while the others were in the Japanese
bazaar, or viewing the scenery of the Alps,
her words fall upon deaf ears,” continues
Wycherley.</p>

<p>“But Scutari dare not attempt violence.”</p>

<p>“You forget he is a Turk, and naturally
brings some of his Bosphorus habits here
with him. Samson Cereal ran away with his
bride in a manner just as bold. More than
one person has come to the World’s Fair and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
never been heard of again. It’s a great maelstrom
of humanity, and a single person could
be sucked out of sight without being noticed.”</p>

<p>Craig is fully aroused.</p>

<p>It comes to him with full force that Heaven
has again been kind. Should Dorothy need
help, to what better use can his muscular
ability be put than in defending her against
this relentless enemy, this Oriental whose one
mission in life, after this lapse of years, seems
to be revenge upon the daring speculator who
robbed him of the bride his gold had bought
on Georgian soil?</p>

<p>He, too, has, by this time, discovered the
pasha, who does not appear to be alone, since
several men hover around him, men wearing
the fez, but whether Turks or not remains to
be seen.</p>

<p>It is as though one were suddenly transported
to a street in Stamboul. In imagination
the sounds incident to that queer city on
the Golden Horn assail the ear: the tinkling
of silvery bells, the strident voice of the muezzin
on the minaret calling to prayer, the dismal
chant of dervishes, the howling of mongrel
curs that after nightfall roam the streets.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
Wycherley, who has been there, rubs his eyes
to make sure he is not dreaming. In the
quaint Midway, surrounded with its remarkable
features, jostling elbows with the odd
people of the other hemisphere, it must always
be hard to realize one is within the city
limits of bustling Chicago, empress of the
West.</p>

<p>The discussion between Dorothy and her
faithless duenna lasts but a couple of minutes,
but this is time enough for Aleck to notice
many things.</p>

<p>It seems almost incredible that Aroun Scutari
should dare attempt such a bold game;
but who can fathom the depths of daring to
which an unscrupulous man will descend when
he desires to see his enemy and go one better!
The clever <i>coup d’état</i> executed by Samson
years ago has remained a thorn in the
pasha’s flesh. Time has served to make the
wound more irritable, and this Mohammedan
comes to the great Fair with but one idea uppermost
in his mind—to find the man who
defied him on Turkish soil, to turn the tables
by stealing his child from under his roof.</p>

<p>Craig grinds his teeth at the bare thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
it is so repugnant to him. Then he realizes
what strange surroundings fate has placed him
amongst. Surely such opportunities for serving
Dorothy can have but one natural outcome—he
may win her, despite the young miner.
The remembrance of this worthy causes Aleck
a qualm, but he banishes the sensation.</p>

<p>Now the two cloaked figures move again.
Dorothy has yielded to her companion’s
guidance, and they are advancing. The
Canadian cannot but admire the proud pose
of the young girl. He remembers that she
faced danger once before in the car of
the Ferris wheel when the crazy professor
was raging about like an escaped mad-house
patient.</p>

<p>Fear is not an element in her heart, and yet
some hidden faculty whispers of danger. She
has never forgotten the awful look of hatred
which this Turk shot into the face of her
father when by chance they met on the Plaisance,
and it has ere now been patent to her
mind that some link in the far away past connects
their destinies.</p>

<p>Seeing the pasha hovering there, Dorothy
has conceived the idea that he means harm to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
her, and while the seductive voice of her
companion assuages her alarm, it is with
something of the feeling with which a soldier
marches up to the muzzle of a cannon that
Dorothy advances in the direction of the Turk.</p>

<p>Then comes the devilish deceit of the
woman who has sold herself for gold. She
knows the time is at hand for delivering the
goods. No doubt the stake is a rich one,
since by this stroke she must sever all connection
with her patroness, upon whose bounty
she has long lived.</p>

<p>This bundle of deceit now turns upon her
unsuspicious companion. The plot has been
carefully arranged, and art is called upon to
render assistance.</p>

<p>Craig and his companion see the woman lay
a hand upon the shoulder of Dorothy; the
latter appears to shake her head negatively.
Then the other draws closer. Why should she
embrace the girl thus? Aleck stares in wonder,
his whole frame thrilled with the strange
character of the scene. As yet he has not
grasped its full meaning.</p>

<p>“Good Heaven! I believe she is fainting!”
he says, with evident excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>“It’s worse than that, my dear boy,” comes
in the voice of his companion, but it sounds
afar off.</p>

<p>“How worse? Good God, man, you don’t
mean that bright, angelic creature has been
stricken with death?” for Dorothy’s struggles
appear to grow weaker, until she lies almost
motionless in the arms of her faithless companion,
a dead weight.</p>

<p>“No, no. What I mean is that she has
succumbed to chloroform, or some devilish
Turkish drug of a similar character, administered
upon the white kerchief that woman
fiend holds over her face—that limbs and mind
are paralyzed, that she may fall into the
spider’s web. Here, look at the monster advancing;
note his grim smile, his hands outstretched
to take his prey, his—— Jove!
Craig, old boy, you’re gone, are you? Well,
here’s after you.”</p>

<p class="chaptitle">YOUNG CANADA ON DECK.</p>


<p>When the full meaning of what has happened
flashes into Craig’s mind—when he
sees Aroun Scutari, lord of the harem and
pasha in the Sultan’s service, about to take
Dorothy Cereal in his arms, it seems as
though an electric battery must have suddenly
become attached to the Canadian, so abrupt
are his movements.</p>

<p>Leaving the side of the actor, while the
other is speaking, he rushes straight for the
scene of the kidnaping. Perhaps love urges
his steps. At least the indignation of an
honorable man sends him forward.</p>

<p>There is no palliation, no excuse for such an
outrage, and hence the feeling he entertains
for Scutari is that of righteous anger. Such a
scene as this, of course, creates excitement.
People gather quickly, no matter if it be a
dog fight on the streets of Constantinople, an
encounter between dragoman and donkey boy
at Cairo on the Nile, an attempted assassination
of a Czar at St. Petersburg, or a duel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
between two bootblacks in front of the City
Hall in New York.</p>

<p>Already a score of people surround the two
women. Questions fly back and forth. The
authoritative manner in which Scutari assumes
charge convinces those present that the lady
who has fainted belongs to him. The veil
hides her face, and while curious glances are
cast in that quarter, none are so lucky as to
see what lies under its screen.</p>

<p>Near by is the exit. Beyond, no doubt, the
Turk has a carriage ready. His years of waiting
seem about to be crowned with triumph—though
he lost the mother he wins the
daughter. Kismet: it is fate.</p>

<p>Unexpected obstacles arise in his path—obstacles
which in his native land he could
brush aside, or at least subdue with the sword,
but which are of a more serious nature under
the civilizing influence of the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>First of all, as the man from Stamboul
is about to take Dorothy in his arms, he
is surprised to find someone tugging at his
sleeve, someone who seems bent upon distracting
his attention, and who will not cease even
when he gives a bearlike shrug.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>When he hears a woman’s voice pouring
upon his devoted head all the miserable names
known in the Turkish language, the pasha,
struck by a sudden recollection, thinks it
worth while to turn his attention thither.</p>

<p>Of course it is the fortune teller; she
realizes the peril of her child. Since the day
when Samson Cereal stole her away, she has
learned to look at the old-time habits of the
Turks with aversion, and the mother love in
her heart, which nothing on earth can destroy,
urges her to save Dorothy.</p>

<p>As well might she appeal to a Nero. This
dark-skinned man comes from a country where
women are bought and sold. As he sees who
thus annoys him, he frowns like a Tartar, and
bellows out a string of oaths strange to the
gathering crowd.</p>

<p>There are those who hear, those who know
his voice but to obey. Two men seize upon
the fortune teller of Cairo Street, and despite
her struggles bear her away.</p>

<p>“She is crazy,” is the only reply they make
to the questions showered upon them, as they
half drag the woman further into the
Plaisance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>Again the triumphant pasha bends forward
to relieve the woman of her lovely burden,
but, shades of Mohammed! what is this that
now descends upon him with the fury of a
young hurricane? What but the Canadian
protectorate, bent upon stepping between
Turkey and the daughter of Chicago!</p>

<p>One fling Craig gives the stout pasha, only
a single flip of his well-trained arms, and the
Oriental goes spinning around like a teetotum
or a whirling dervish, bringing up in the arms
of a gay young fellow who has just come from
the beer tables of Old Vienna and is consequently
in a hilarious condition.</p>

<p>“Set ’em up in t’other alley,” he shouts;
“don’t send ’em in so hard. Whoop! now
you’re in the game, old man; back you go,”
with which the breezy reveler gives Aroun
Scutari another whirl, which sends him halfway
back again, a collision with an elderly
woman bringing his mad dance to a sudden
stop, as both of them fall over, and her
startled screams add to the clamor.</p>

<p>No sooner has Aleck entered the affair than
he has his hands full.</p>

<p>His action in seizing upon the sacred person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
of the Turk was equivalent to throwing down
the gauntlet, and the Canadian is immediately
set upon by a number of worthies whose itching
palms have been crossed with the gold that
makes them slaves to Scutari.</p>

<p>He is in his element, this man of Montreal:
not that such a brawl is to his liking, but the
object for which he strives is a sacred one to a
gentleman—the defense of innocence.</p>

<p>They are four to one, and ugly customers at
that. Aleck is no Admirable Crichton, and if
left to himself, no matter how gallant his
attack, he must presently go down before the
numbers opposed to him.</p>

<p>The crowd seems paralyzed; in an affair of
this kind, men usually believe it none of their
business, but stand by and let those interested
fight it out.</p>

<p>Through the fringe of spectators, however,
someone pushes a way. It is Wycherley in
search of his friend, and upon seeing Aleck so
beset he throws himself into the breach, which
evens up the game a little. More help comes
from an unexpected quarter. The half-intoxicated
young fellow, whose muscular ability
sent Scutari flying on the back trip, has evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
been spoiling for a fight. He picks out
his man and faces him with the air of a
scientific boxer, dazzles the eyes of the Oriental
by the rapid use of his hands, and rains such a
shower of blows upon him that the fellow,
believing him a wizard with the six arms of a
Chinese god, bellows for mercy.</p>

<p>The action has been swift, and the field
won. Aroun Scutari reads his defeat in the
signs so apparent, and wisely steals away.
His minions sneak after him. Aleck turns to
the woman who still holds the limp figure of
Dorothy. It galls him to see one arm thrown
about the neck of the treacherous woman, and
Dorothy’s head resting on her shoulder.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to say to you, madam.
Your duplicity, your double-dealing, is known
to me. I shall take the first opportunity to disclose
it to your victim. Meantime you must
assist me in getting her home—do you hear?”</p>

<p>She bows her head. This double break in
her plans has taken all the confidence out of
the woman who could plot against her best
friend. She now fears the result—for if Samson
Cereal is once aroused against her she
may well tremble for her fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“Claude, see that she comes; we will find
a carriage outside, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll get one for you, boys,” cheerfully
declares the young roysterer, as he endeavors
to walk a straight line to the exit.</p>

<p>With a strange feeling thrilling him through
and through Aleck bends down and takes the
young girl in his arms. She is not entirely
senseless, for though her head droops upon
his shoulder, he hears a fluttering breath and
the words:</p>

<p>“Oh, my father!”</p>

<p>Reverently he raises his burden.</p>

<p>“Make way, friends,” he says to those in
front, and the crowd parts before him. They
have by this time managed to get an inkling
of the truth through their heads, and between
the dark-skinned Turk and the frank-faced
Canadian their sympathies are wholly with
the latter.</p>

<p>Strange to say, no Columbian guard has put
in an appearance during the extraordinary
fracas. They were everywhere when not
wanted.</p>

<p>The exit is close at hand, and as they pass
through Aleck sees a figure with waving arms,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
a figure he has no trouble in recognizing as
their quondam partner in the late deal.</p>

<p>“This way! here’s your coach; step up lively
now, gentlemen. We’re off over the divide.”</p>

<p>His incoherent jumble is enough to attract
Aleck’s attention to the carriage, and he carefully
deposits his burden inside.</p>

<p>“Enter,” he says to the woman beside
Wycherley. She would refuse, but his voice
terrifies her, and she obeys.</p>

<p>“Claude, tell the driver where to go. Then
get in with me,” he adds calmly, and it is
evident that even more than the strange
events of this night of nights is needed to
rattle Aleck Craig.</p>

<p>A moment later Wycherley gets in.</p>

<p>“Jove! that chap insists on sitting beside
the driver, and rather than have a row I let
him.”</p>

<p>“Who the deuce is he?”</p>

<p>“Give it up! Muttered something about
Happy Jack, and as he’s always singing
snatches of songs or laughing. I reckon he
means the name for himself. Happy Jack—well,
he’s to be envied such a disposition in
this vale of tears.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>“Hello! what’s wrong now? I thought
you were about as free from care as the next
one?”</p>

<p>“In times gone by. As luck would have it
I just saw the adorable Inez.”</p>

<p>“Oh! the pretty Spanish cigar girl.”</p>

<p>“It is too true—perfidious Inez.”</p>

<p>“Come, come, remember your philosophy.”</p>

<p>“But she was with another—a dashing
young chap with the strut of a huzzar. I
shall have to reduce him to the humble gait
of a cork leg. Her glance was freezing. I am
still like a cake of ice.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she saw you had company—that
it was jealousy influenced her.”</p>

<p>“Aleck, bless you, my dear boy. I take
heart, I breathe again.”</p>

<p>Craig turns his attention to the woman who
sits opposite, next the actor. The vehicle is
making good progress, but it will be a wearisome
journey to the North side.</p>

<p>“Before we reach this young lady’s home,
madam, it is but fair that you and I should
have some sort of explanation. You were
supposed to be her protector; you betrayed
your trust. I know all: your alliance with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
Aroun Scutari, and everything that followed.
You must quit her service to-morrow, for I
mean to expose you.”</p>

<p>“I shall do as you say, sir. There is no
need of explanations on my part. You would
denounce my story as a fabrication; but I
had cause, I had cause. What do you wish
me to do to-night?”</p>

<p>“Assist in getting the young lady under her
father’s roof, from which she should never
have ventured on any such Quixotic errand.”</p>

<p>“You blame me for it, I know; but it was
her own idea—she planned it all, and what
followed the pasha took advantage of,” she
insists.</p>

<p>It is on the tip of his tongue to ask about
the young miner, but he suddenly shuts his
teeth together and changes his mind. Aleck
Craig has a fine sense of honor.</p>

<p>“You have placed yourself in a position
where you are liable to criminal prosecution,”
he says sternly.</p>

<p>The woman laughs scornfully.</p>

<p>“You would not dare proceed against me,”
she says.</p>

<p>“And why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>“Because my sweet mistress would have
to testify in court, and expose her own
actions. I know them to be entirely innocent—that
her motives were actuated by the
holiest feelings of the heart, but the public
would choose to believe otherwise. And to
defend myself I would have to unearth family
secrets that would make the name of Samson
Cereal the talk of the town. Now, will you
prosecute, sir?”</p>

<p>“We shall be content if you leave your
place in the morning,” replies Aleck discreetly.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE PROTECTORATE ABANDONED.</p>


<p>Dorothy is recovering; already she has
moved, and it is evident that the influence of
the drug, whatever it may have been, is wearing
away. The jolting of the carriage may
have something to do with her coming back to
her senses, for they have not yet struck the
boulevard pavement of Michigan Avenue, and
the street is in bad order.</p>

<p>“Oh, where am I?” she suddenly cries out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>“With friends, I trust, Miss Dorothy,” says
Craig.</p>

<p>They pass an electric arc—she bends her
eyes upon his face, and an exclamation
announces that she has recognized him.</p>

<p>“You? I thought it was that terrible
Turk. What have you done this for, Mr.
Craig?” and he is delighted to discover a
tremulous undertone to her voice—it tells of
anxiety.</p>

<p>“I see you fail to understand the situation,
Miss Dorothy. Compose yourself. You are
now on the way home. My friend and I
chanced along just in time to put the Turk
and his followers to flight, to the amusement
of the crowd. We knew no other course to
pursue than to engage a carriage and take you
both home.”</p>

<p>“And Mrs. Merrick—was she injured?”
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I am here, my dear, and unhurt,” purrs
the companion, her manner reminding Craig of
the house cat that has sheathed her claws.</p>

<p>“Oh, it has been indeed fortunate! Then
again we owe you a debt of gratitude, Mr.
Craig. How strange!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>“How delightful!” he echoes cheerily, desiring
to arouse her to something like her old
self.</p>

<p>“You are very kind. What could it all
mean? I am so puzzled. That odious Turk
with the eyes that make me think of a rattlesnake—what
did he mean to do with me?”</p>

<p>“I can only hazard a guess, Miss Dorothy.
In his country they have strange customs,
you know. Wives are bought, not wooed.
Sometimes they are stolen and the settlement
made later on. Perhaps this pasha has
imagined he can bring his heathen habits over
to America. He has evidently fallen in love
with you, and desires you for his wife.”</p>

<p>“The wretch! Why, they have a dozen or
two. I have seen the inside of a harem at
Algiers,” she says indignantly.</p>

<p>“That is very true; but, looking at things
from his standpoint, he was probably offering
you the highest compliment he understood.”</p>

<p>By degrees he manages to interest her in
other subjects. She does not seem to suspect
that it was Mrs. Merrick who held the handkerchief
over her face, and robbed her of her
senses, but believes the Turk himself did this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>It is a strange ride. Wycherley has been
introduced, and manages to put in a word now
and then, though unusually quiet for him.
Perhaps he is thinking of how near he came
to occupying the position the Canadian has
taken—or it may be he speculates on the possibilities
of his great deal for the morrow.</p>

<p>At length they cross the State Street bridge
and reach the North Side of Chicago, but quite
a stretch still intervenes, for the old speculator
has his mansion out near Lincoln Park, being
one of the favored few whom fortune allows
to gaze upon the magnificent lake from his
library windows.</p>

<p>Dorothy has become reserved. She realizes
that this gentleman, who has several times
been of such assistance to her, must look upon
her escapade of the night with curiosity at
least. True, she is not responsible for what
occurred on the Ferris wheel, or near the exit
of the Midway; but somehow her participation
in such scenes reflects upon the wisdom
of a young lady attending the Fair at night
with only a companion of her own sex.</p>

<p>Her lips are sealed with reference to a certain
subject, and she evidently does not suspect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
that Craig has seen her in company with
the young miner.</p>

<p>On his part Craig feels a genuine regret to
remember what the Colorado sheriff told him
in connection with John Phœnix, whose
downfall is bound to suddenly occur. Perhaps,
when he comes to know her better, he
may be able to learn what peculiar bond there
is between these two—who can tell the
vagaries that flit through the mind of a
bachelor in love. If this young fellow has
won her regard, and his true character comes
out with his arrest for embezzlement, perhaps—well,
hearts have before now been caught in
the rebound.</p>

<p>At length he forces himself to speak again
upon the subject of her return. Perhaps she
might not like to drive up to her father’s
house?</p>

<p>She laughs for the first time since entering
the carriage, and it pleases Craig to hear her.</p>

<p>“If you knew me better, Mr. Craig, you
would never suspect me of being afraid in
anything that concerns the dear old governor.
He idolizes me. If I say I’m going to Japan
to-morrow he would never throw an obstacle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
in my way. Though a bear to others, he’s the
dearest and best man in the world to me.
That is why I have dared to undertake this
task—through love for him.”</p>

<p>He wonders what task, but is not rude
enough to ask. They roll between elegant
mansions on Dearborn Avenue, and will soon
be at their destination.</p>

<p>“Then you will alight in front of your
door?”</p>

<p>“If you please, sir.”</p>

<p>No more is said, each being busy with
thoughts that come unbidden into the mind.
The driver has been coached and knows where
to turn. At length the carriage stops.
Dorothy looks out.</p>

<p>“It is home,” she says quietly.</p>

<p>Immediately the gentlemen are out to assist
the ladies. One glance Craig gives at the
huge pile of masonry and he has impressed
the location of the princely mansion on his
mind. It rather staggers him to think of this
young girl, the sole heiress to great wealth,
having passed through such singular adventures
on this night. Craig is a Canadian, and,
in a measure, accustomed to English ways.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
He wonders what his people would think of
such an escapade, and smiles at the recollection
of his austere aunt, so proud of her blue
blood and of an unblemished name. It is
the destiny of Canadians to draw nearer
the American, while separating from the
English, and the younger generation feel this
more and more in the drift of commerce.</p>

<p>So Aleck, while brought up with a keen
perception of the proprieties, can even pardon
such a breach of the same under certain circumstances.
Somehow he lays much stress
on the personal declaration that her motives
are governed by sacred purposes. Not that he
can understand it—he does not attempt to do
so—but there is a charm in Dorothy’s presence
that makes him believe whatever she may say.</p>

<p>’Twas ever thus. A man in love is fain to
pin his faith on the goodness of the ethereal
being who has charmed him. All others may
be false, deceptive, and born flirts, but this
one bright, particular star is an exception.
That is the subtle glamour love dusts in the
eyes of his votaries. Whom the little god
would secure in his net, he first makes blind.</p>

<p>“I cannot thank you for your kindness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
Mr. Craig. Perhaps by to-morrow night I
shall be in a better condition to talk upon this
subject. I feel that an explanation is due
you,” she says, giving him her hand.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that, Miss Cereal,” he
says.</p>

<p>“But you will come?” she adds eagerly.</p>

<p>He tries to keep his feelings in subjection
by remembering the strange companion with
whom Dorothy sauntered about the Midway,
and who certainly took upon himself all the
airs of a lover. Only in this way can he subdue
the sudden spasm of exaltation that sends
the hot blood leaping through his veins at the
solicitude of her voice.</p>

<p>“I promised, and unless something prevents
me I shall be there, glad of the opportunity
to meet your father.”</p>

<p>Then she says good night, and runs up the
steps. A light burns in the hall. Mrs. Merrick
lingers a minute to say a few words.</p>

<p>“I will keep my promise, depend upon it,
young sir. Some time you may know my
story, and perhaps you will believe I have not
been wholly actuated by a love of money.”</p>

<p>Then she follows her young mistress up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
steps. A servant has just opened the heavy
door, and Aleck can see the handsome hall.</p>

<p>The young reveler on the seat beside the
driver has reached the pavement.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, gents, but is there room inside
for a chap of my size? Devilish hard
seat up there, you know. Here, driver, 's your
pay,” handing him a bill with the air only a
royal prince or a roysterer half seas over can
assume.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances what can Aleck
do—objections to the stranger paying would
be useless, and possibly stir up his fighting
blood, for men in his condition are exceedingly
touchy. He feels an interest in the fellow,
since he came to their relief in time of need,
so they all enter the vehicle, giving the name
of the hotel at which they stop. It chances
that Aleck names the Sherman House, and the
stranger bursts out with:</p>

<p>“My hotel—singular coincidence—something
of a pleasure. Glad to know you, sir.
Wake me up when we arrive, kindly. Good.
Find shares sixteen above par—Hecla two
hundred and three. Oceans of money—no
cares—a jolly life—see you later perhaps——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>And he sleeps the fitful slumber that
follows over-indulgence in drink. Aleck
manages to settle him in a corner, and seats
himself beside the actor, who has been regarding
the scene with something like amusement.</p>

<p>“Pretty far gone, aint he?” remarks
Wycherley.</p>

<p>“Disgusting. What a shame; looks like a
bright young fellow, too.”</p>

<p>“Well-loaded with long green,” asserts the
actor.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, I don’t quite understand.”</p>

<p>“I mean smartly heeled.”</p>

<p>“I’m still in the dark.”</p>

<p>Wycherley laughs.</p>

<p>“I forgot you were from over the border and
not up to our professional terms. What I
would imply is that he is a man of means, of
money.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“He took the bill from a great roll. The
driver’s eyes stuck out of his head at the
sight.”</p>

<p>“It’s a shame, then, that he puts himself in
a condition to be robbed. Judging from his
talk I should say he was from the West.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“Singular we should run across so many
persons from that quarter. And this isn’t
Colorado day, either. There’s the sheriff,
then Phœnix, who is wanted out in Denver,
and finally this young chap.”</p>

<p>“Phœnix! yes, I know him,” utters the
man in the corner, as if the name has caught
his ear, deaf to all other sounds.</p>

<p>“Talk lower, Claude. Where do you put
up?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have a room,” carelessly.</p>

<p>“Won’t you stay over with me at the
Sherman to-night?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t think of it, my dear boy. Very
fussy about my quarters; cranky bachelor,
you know. Have to be just so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see! and a room in a hotel is a
cheerless waste in comparison. I can see the
cozy chair, the papers and magazines at hand,
pipes on the tables, in fact, a comfortable <i>den</i>.”</p>

<p>“That’s it; you just describe the very thing,
Aleck. Nothing like home comforts. Only
apt to unfit us for the rough experiences of
life; that’s the only fault I’ve got to find.
Here’s the Sherman—take care of the young
chap—and good-night.”</p>

<p class="chaptitle">A BACHELOR’S “DEN.”</p>


<p>After leaving the Sherman House Wycherley
has the driver take him down Michigan
Avenue. He produces a cigar, one of Aleck’s
choice weeds. Then comes a match.</p>

<p>“Ah! this is solid comfort,” he muses,
stretching his legs out on the front seat as if
eager to fill the whole vehicle; “it is my dream
realized: a private carriage, a fine weed—perfect
happiness. When my million comes
home, I’ve got it all laid out. It won’t take
me long to spend it. I can shut my eyes and
imagine I’m a McCormick or a Cereal going
home to my palatial abode. It’s just elegant,
you know.”</p>

<p>Thus he chuckles and interviews himself
after a habit peculiarly his own, until suddenly
the vehicle draws up to the curb.</p>

<p>“Twenty-first Street, sir,” says John, who is
especially good-natured after receiving the fat
fee from the young roysterer.</p>

<p>Wycherley alights with great dignity.</p>

<p>“Good-night, my man,” he says, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
driver, impressed with his air, answers respectfully.</p>

<p>The ex-actor saunters along the avenue
until the hack has vanished. Then he turns
on his heel and retraces his steps to the
corner. Along Twenty-first Street he walks.
At this hour of the night, the dividing line
between two days, there are few people
abroad, and Wycherley meets no one on his
tramp.</p>

<p>As he advances the neighborhood grows
more squalid, until he is in one of the poorest
sections of the city, not far from the railroad.</p>

<p>At length he pauses in front of a dilapidated
frame, evidently a tenement—pauses
with a dramatic gesture, and mutters:</p>

<p>“Behold! the Hotel des Vagabonde, where
thieves never break through and steal; where
no one rolls and groans from an overloaded
stomach; the home of the highway prince,
the boot-black cavalier, and the jolly old
bachelor. Waive all ceremony and enter, my
dear boy. I’ll not arouse the janitor, poor
fellow. And as I’m a wise man I’ll extinguish
this cigar for a double reason—it’ll give
me a morning smoke, and prevent a sensation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
in the princely hotel, for a Havana is unknown
in this region of powerful clay pipes,
and the odor might offend the fastidous nose
of some lodger, when there would be the
deuce to pay.”</p>

<p>No sooner said than done.</p>

<p>At the door no keeper challenges his entrance;
day and night it is free to all.
Wycherley climbs various flights of rickety
stairs. It is very dark, but he seems to know
from intuition just where every broken board
lies, and the higher he gets, the lighter his
spirits grow. He hums an operatic air and
changes it to “After the Ball.” Really this
man makes light of care—troubles sit upon
him like bubbles.</p>

<p>Now he stops in front of a door, fumbles in
his pocket, finds a key, and enters.</p>

<p>“Where the deuce is that electric button?
very queer I fail to find it. Well, making a
virtue of necessity I’ll have to fall back on
Old Reliable.”</p>

<p>A match crackles, the flame shoots up.
Then he applied it to the wick of a candle
stuck in the neck of an old beer bottle.</p>

<p>The scene is a remarkable one! Rarely did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
candlelight illumine a more destitute room.
From the wall large pieces of plaster are
gone, ditto the ceiling. A general survey of
the place would result about as follows: <i>imprimus:</i>
the lone bachelor himself; <i>item:</i> one
trundle bed, scantily clad and sadly in need
of smoothing; <i>item:</i> a carpet bag with a tendency
to falling over on one side because of
constitutional leanness; <i>items:</i> a piece of looking-glass
fastened to the wall, a single wooden
chair, a tin basin, a bare table on which the
candle holds full sway.</p>

<p>That is the sum total.</p>

<p>Wycherley, merry dog that he is, glances
around him with the air of a king. He has
a faculty of seeing luxury behind misery, of
making much out of little.</p>

<p>“Ah! Aleck was a shrewd one to guess
what comforts I enjoy. There is my luxurious
armchair; this my heap of magazines and
papers,”—picking up a penny afternoon
<i>News</i>—“and the whole scene one of comfort.
Ah, this is living. Now for my meerschaum,
my slippers. Hang the luck! I believe that
valet has misplaced them again. Never mind,
this will do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>He kicks off his shoes, opens a drawer in
the table and takes out a clay-pipe minus half
the stem. This he fills with scrap tobacco,
holds it to the candle and puffs away with an
enjoyment that cannot all be assumed.</p>

<p>“A strange night it has been. To think I’d
meet Aleck and Bob Rocket so near together—two
fellows I regard so highly. It’s a queer
world, and a mighty small one, too, when you
come down to it. Heigho! my chances of
wedding the heiress are <i>nil</i>. Upon the whole
I must confess to a certain relief. How foolish
for a man to give up the free life of a gay
bachelor, with its delightful uncertainties, for
double harness and the harassing cares of
stocks and bonds. Ugh! deliver me. See
how cozy I am! Who would care to change
it?”</p>

<p>Then he consults his memorandum book
and makes a few notes on the market, gaining
his points from the closing sales as reported in
the newspaper. After this he yawns.</p>

<p>“Heigho! I feel weary. My sumptuous
couch invites repose. It calls not in vain.
To sleep, to dream, perchance to discover in
second sight how to-morrow’s market will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
jump. ’Tis a consummation devoutly to be
wished.”</p>

<p>His preparations for going to bed are simple
indeed. He removes his coat and vest; his
collar and necktie follow; then he crawls
under the army blanket.</p>

<p>“The deuce! I forgot to douse that ten
candle electric light. Shall I call Robert to
press the button? Let the weary retainer
sleep. Thus bright genius overcomes all
obstacles.”</p>

<p>One of his shoes flies through space with
unerring accuracy, over goes beer bottle and
candle, and, rolling off the table, lands with a
thump on the bare floor.</p>

<p>“Eureka! score one for Sir Claude de
Wycherley. Must practice that little game;
save immense amount of trouble. Hard on
the bottle, though. Now to woo the gentle
goddess of slumber. Think of the untold
thousands rolling on feather beds and hair
mattresses. Little they know of the genuine
luxury of a shuck bed. This is comfort now,
you bet.”</p>

<p>The night wind sighs through a hole in a
window pane, and lulled by this music, supplemented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
by the ringing of engine bells, and an
occasional shriek from a switching locomotive,
Wycherley falls asleep.</p>

<p>For an hour or two only his stentorian
breathing can be heard in the tenement room.</p>

<p>Then the man on the cot suddenly sits up.
His room is no longer in darkness.</p>

<p>“Jove! that was a beastly dream I had.
What a pleasure to awaken and find it was
only a dream. Can it be morning? What the
devil is all that racket outside, people shouting?
Bless me! I believe it’s the engines pumping.
There must be a fire in the neighborhood.
I’m sorry for the poor wretches; never
took any enjoyment seeing a house burn.
Tchew! bless my soul, the room’s half full
of smoke. Think I’ll get up and investigate.
Too bad to have a gentleman’s slumbers disturbed
in this way, but I’m interested now,
because, you know, it might be the Hotel des
Vagabonde that is ablaze.”</p>

<p>While he thus communes with himself he
gropes around for the lost shoe, and draws it
on. Then he goes to the door. As he opens
it a volume of smoke pours in. He instantly
closes the door again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>“I declare, it is this house, after all.
Another experience, my boy. My palatial
mansion is doomed, I fear. Ho! for the
salvage corps. Is my account book, the
repository of millions, safe? Then let the fire
demon do his worst.”</p>

<p>He even stops to button his collar; then seizing
the lean grip, he waves his hand around
him in a majestic way.</p>

<p>“The best of friends must part. Many
happy hours have I spent here. Alas! that
it should end thus. Farewell, farewell, and
if forever, then forever fare thee well.”</p>

<p>He opens the door and steps into the hall.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” he exclaims.</p>

<p>Dense smoke fills the hallway. The crackling
of flames makes mad music, and
when this is supplemented by the shrieks of
terrified women, shouts of firemen, the throbbing
of engines, and a dull roar from the dense
crowd that collected like magic under such circumstances,
the result is a combination that
once heard can never be forgotten.</p>

<p>Wycherley looks down the stairway and
immediately draws back again. Even his remarkable
nerve is shaken by the sight. Besides,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
he hears cries near by that tell him he
is not the only one imprisoned in the upper
story of this old tenement, now in flames—cries
that can only come from a terrified woman.</p>

<p>“Think, old boy, and if ever you cudgeled
your brains, do so now. It’s useless trying to
get out below—rather too warm for comfort.
How about the other way?”</p>

<p>The flames are roaring up the stairway, and
whatever is done must be done quickly, or
else it will be too late. He remembers some
sort of ladder leading to a trap in the roof.
It offers a chance. Whether the situation will
be improved or not, who can say?</p>

<p>Groping his way through the terrible smoke,
he lays hold on the ladder. Just then from a
room near by comes the wail:</p>

<p>“Oh, God! help me, save me, and I will
undo the past. I swear it. Help! help!”</p>

<p>Wycherley recognizes a woman’s voice.
He is not a hero, lays no claim to be such, but
if death is the inevitable consequence he cannot
try to save himself and desert a fellow
creature. Down goes his carpet bag, and in
five seconds he is at the door of the other room
in the upper story of the burning tenement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>“Who’s here?” he shouts.</p>

<p>A figure at the small window, almost in the
act of casting herself out, turns to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, save me, sir! It is too horrible! I am
not fit to die. Save me!” she pleads wildly.</p>

<p>“Be quiet! I’ll do the best I can, but you
must obey orders. Come with me,” he says.</p>

<p>“Not down there! no, no. I looked—it
was like the fires of hell!”</p>

<p>“To the roof! we must get out of this smoke
or we’ll suffocate before the fire touches us.
Come, and I will save you or we’ll die trying.”</p>

<p>His cheering words reassure the poor
woman, and she clings to his coat. They
reach the stairs leading upward, and Wycherley
mounting, opens the trap. What a
blessed relief—here they can at least get a
breath of air.</p>

<p>Once upon the roof of the tenement the
ex-actor casts about him for some means of
escape, some method by which to cheat the
hungry flames that must speedily burst
through and envelop the whole tenement in
their rapacious maw.</p>

<p>The case seems desperate; no friendly roof
offers a refuge. On one side a great warehouse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
fire-proof and grim, rears itself; on the
other lies a smaller building, with the roof far
below. If he had a rope Wycherley can see
how he might escape. Without one the case is
almost hopeless. Already ladders have rested
against the building, but none are long
enough to reach to the top. They see him.
Shouts in the street below announce this fact—encouraging
cries that give him hope. A
stream of water breaks above and showers
them. Wycherley turns up his coat.</p>

<p>“Pardon—it is my last collar,” he says
calmly.</p>

<p>They have placed a ladder against the
smaller house. Brave firemen are bringing
another which will be carried up the sloping
roof, and used to reach those above.</p>

<p>All that now may be considered is the question
of time. Will they succeed, or be too
late? The fire is having everything its own
way. These old tenements burn like match
wood. Already the flames have eaten a hole
through the roof, and curl and twist wickedly
as though stretching out eager hands for new
victims.</p>

<p>The heat is growing unbearable, and yet the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
ladder is not in position. He realizes that the
case is desperate, and casts about for a chance
to lessen it. The woman lies there groaning.
They are dragging the ladder up the roof, and
in a couple of minutes it will be in place, but
that time is an eternity under such conditions.
Just now, to remain means death.
He sees one chance, takes the woman—she is
a slight creature—in his arms, slips over the
edge of the roof, and with feet braced on a
ledge, exerts his whole strength to maintain
his position, while the encouraging shouts
of the firemen below give him hope. It is a
picture for an artist—the race between life and
death, between the greedy flames and the uplifting
ladder, but the ladder wins.</p>

</div>

<p class="chaptitle">THE MAN OF THE WORLD.</p>


<p>When the man who hangs there with such
a weight upon his left arm feels that he cannot
endure the strain five seconds longer, a
voice shouts out just at his feet:</p>

<p>“Drop her down to me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>Brawny arms are outstretched, and the
woman, falling from his nerveless clasp, is
caught and held. Now that he can change
his position Wycherley is not so hard set, and
manages without assistance to lower himself.</p>

<p>It has been an exceedingly narrow escape,
for hardly has he reached the lower roof
when, looking up, he beholds the greedy
tongues of fire crawling over the edge at the
very point where he held on with such grim
resolution.</p>

<p>A scuttle has been torn open, and through
this the woman has been taken. Wycherley
would linger, but the firemen tell him nothing
can save this house from sharing the fate of its
neighbor, and that he had better lose no time
in making good his escape.</p>

<p>So he, too, crawls through the scuttle. Even
in such dire distress and under such peculiarly
unromantic conditions his sense of humor
does not desert him, and he chuckles more
than once while making his way to the street.
When tenements burn there are sad enough
sights, Heaven knows, but at the same time
many comical ones crop up, for people in the
mad excitement may be seen hugging feather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
beds, while tossing pictures, mirrors, and
every fragile object out of the window.</p>

<p>Hardly has he reached the street than someone
near by says:</p>

<p>“There he is.”</p>

<p>Immediately hands are laid upon his arm,
and turning he beholds a woman.</p>

<p>“God bless you, sir. You saved my life.
I cannot find words to thank you,” she says,
between her hysterical sobs.</p>

<p>“Then don’t worry about trying. What
I did wasn’t much,” is his characteristic
answer.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir! my life is not of much value to
me, but to another it may be. Tell me your
name—where I can find you after I have seen
him.”</p>

<p>He notes curious glances cast upon them,
and desires to break away.</p>

<p>“A letter to Claude Wycherley at the Sherman
House would reach me. But I beg of
you to forget all about it,” he adds.</p>

<p>Reporters are as thick as peas, and he
would avoid them if possible, not wanting to
figure in a sensation. Wycherley is so retiring
in his disposition, so modest withal, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
any such notoriety might embarrass him
exceedingly.</p>

<p>“Where have I seen that woman before?
Don’t ever recollect meeting her in the Hotel
des Vagabonde, now, alas! no more; and yet
her face seems so familiar to me. Give it up.
Where now, my dear boy? The clock strikes
four. Daylight will be along—even now I see
it creeping up over the lake. To pass the
time until then—ah! here’s a bootblack’s
chair. Quite an idea. I’ll keep it warm
until it’s time for breakfast,” saying which he
sits down and dozes.</p>

<p>The great city is waking up. As day comes
wagons rumble by and working people with
buckets in hand swing past to their labors.
Soon the shrill cry of the newsboy is heard in
the land.</p>

<p>“Tribune—Times—Inter-Ocean!”</p>

<p>Wycherley sinks a hand in his pocket, and
after a thorough and systematic search in
order that he may corner all fugitive pieces,
he draws out sundry nickels and coppers,
which, upon being marshaled upon the palm
of his hand, he counts.</p>

<p>“Twenty cents, sum total; not a fortune,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
it’s true, but better than I’ve known many a
time. Let’s see how I’ll divide it: five for a
paper, ten for breakfast, and the last nickel
brings a cigar. There’s luxury for you; a
prince could have no more. Hi! boy, come
here.”</p>

<p>In another minute the paper has changed
hands.</p>

<p>“Now to feed the inner man, who clamors
for attention. Over a cup of coffee and some
rolls in a beanery near by, I’ll read my fortune.
What a delicious state of uncertainty—it’s
heads or tails whether I win or lose a million.
Then I enjoy all the sensations of the
greatest plunger and never risk a dollar. I
must copyright my scheme. Hello! what’s
this?”</p>

<p>He has come upon a little girl crying—a
child who belongs in the poorer walks of life,
for her clothes are scanty, and her face thin.
She sobs as though her heart would break.</p>

<p>“Come, come, what is the matter, my
child?” he asks, touched by her despair.</p>

<p>“I can’t find it, and it was all granny had.”</p>

<p>“What have you lost, then?”</p>

<p>“She sent me out last night to buy something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
to eat, and I fell down and lost the
money. I came early this morning to look,
but I can’t find it. She won’t have any breakfast,
poor old granny. I’ve cried nearly all
night, but she told me never to mind, that
God would find it for me in the morning, but
I guess he forgot.”</p>

<p>Indeed, her swollen eyes give evidence that
what she says is true.</p>

<p>Wycherley makes a grimace, but sturdily
puts his hand in his pocket.</p>

<p>“How much was it, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Only fifteen cents, sir, but it was all
granny had, and she won’t get any more till
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“A mere trifle, my child. There you are.
Don’t mind saying thanks, but be very, very
careful not to drop any.”</p>

<p>Her looks are eloquent enough as she
goes skipping along toward the grocery.
Wycherley watches her and then chuckles.</p>

<p>“There goes my breakfast, and the cigar,
too. Well, what of it? ’Tisn’t the first time
you’ve fasted, my boy, and may not be the
last. Good for the digestion, don’t you know.
Besides, you’re invited to dinner at the Sherman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
House with Aleck, and a sharp appetite
will give you more of a chance to enjoy the
good things of life. It’s brought relief to one
small heart, anyway. Now, I might as well
return to my chair and settle this question of
a million. If I’ve won I can lay back and
imagine a royal banquet fit for the gods.”</p>

<p>Presently he is scanning the reports.</p>

<p>“What’s this? Unexpected advance in
Golconda mining stock—I was deep in that.
Decline of Reading. I skipped that, glad to
say. How about the Consolidated on which
I spread? I can hardly see for excitement.
What’s that, advanced two cents? Hurrah!
and I only hoped for one. Sell out, sell out,
don’t hold anything a minute later. I’ve gone
and done it. Yes, sir, as sure as fate, I’m a
<i>millionaire</i>. No thirteen dollars this time;
all previous losses wiped out and something
like a million to my credit. Think of it, a <i>cool</i>
million, too. Champagne—no, that wouldn’t
do on an empty stomach. I’ll hie away to
Kinsey’s, and scan his bill of fare. This settles
it. I’m cut out for a broker. The whole
secret is to stand by your colors long enough,
and success is certain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>Someone grasps his foot, and looking down
he sees the bootblack commencing operations.</p>

<p>“Hold on there, boy! just gave the last
fifteen cents I had to a little girl who lost her
money. You’ll have to trust me or take this
paper in pay.”</p>

<p>The boy grins and says the paper will do
him, so Wycherley makes some notes from it.</p>

<p>“Haven’t time to figure, now. May be a difference
of a hundred thousand or so either
way, but <i>that</i> doesn’t matter. There’s that
woman’s face before my mind again. Where
have I seen her? Stupid in me to forget asking
her name when I gave mine. Well, let
it pass—a memory like many others in a
checkered career. Ah! done, boy? Thanks.
I’ll leave you the paper and call again.”</p>

<p>It is just twelve when Wycherley turns up
at the hotel, and finds Aleck awaiting him.
No one would think the jolly actor had not
eaten a bite since the previous night. He has
great command over his system, and although
the aroma of the soup almost overcomes him
he restrains his fierce ardor. Above all it is
his aim to act the gentleman.</p>

<p>“I see you’ve been up to your old tricks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
again, Claude,” says the Canadian kindly, as
he looks into the face of the adventurer.</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean, my dear boy. Surely
four o’clock was too late for a morning paper.”</p>

<p>“I had the whole thing from the lips of
a party who was an eye-witness—who heard
you give your name to the poor woman you
rescued.”</p>

<p>“The deuce you say. I hoped it wouldn’t
get out.”</p>

<p>“And I’m proud to know you, to be your
friend, Claude Wycherley. More than that,
you builded better than you knew, comrade.”</p>

<p>“How now, Aleck?”</p>

<p>“This gentleman took the woman you
saved to a boarding-house near by. I confess
something of curiosity, and a desire to hear her
story direct, led my steps there after breakfast.
Then again I had an idea she might be poor
and needy, and, if so, I might second your
deed. At any rate, I walked down and found
her. She glowed with enthusiasm over your
kindness, and described the whole scene so
eloquently that I could, in imagination, see
you hanging from that roof with one arm and
supporting her—you who professed to be all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
in a tremble at the prospect of climbing the
Ferris wheel. I can understand that now,
my dear fellow, and know full well it was not
timidity that kept you back, but the sturdy
desire to baffle Aroun Scutari in the climax of
his work.</p>

<p>“Enough of that. Now comes the surprising
part of the business. When I talked with
the woman I saw she was much more refined
than her position would indicate. She asked
questions, too, and eager ones they were;
questions about Samson Cereal, questions
that aroused my suspicions.</p>

<p>“Then I turned the tables and she confided
her story to me, at least the outlines of it.
You could have knocked me down with a
feather, I was so astonished. Of course, you
have never even guessed her identity—how
could you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. You mention Samson
Cereal—a wife of his turned up last night;
perhaps she is another,” carelessly.</p>

<p>“Claude, you wizard, go up head.”</p>

<p>“What! is it a fact?” demands the
amazed Wycherley.</p>

<p>“As true as gospel. His first wife. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
divorced from her before he went abroad, and
I have reason to believe she is the mother of
this bold John Phœnix!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="chaptitle">HEARD AT THE SHERMAN TABLE-D’HÔTE.</p>


<p>No wonder Wycherley stops eating and
looks at his companion in a dazed way. The
announcement made by the other is of a nature
to take his breath away. What sort of man
can Samson Cereal be? It is quite enough,
he thinks, to have one wife, who was supposed
to be dead, turn up, but two of a kind—quite
staggers him.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment, Aleck, until I collect my
wits. Really, you have knocked them helter-skelter
with such a remarkable assertion.
There, now, go on with the circus. This
woman, whom I had the good fortune to assist,
was once the wife of the old speculator, you
say.”</p>

<p>“It is true. They were married when he
was a young man—just at the close of the
War. I believe he met her in Kentucky, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
she was a native of Lexington, and called a
beauty, and I imagine somewhat of a flirt.</p>

<p>“Some years later a child was born to them,
a boy. Samson began to suspect his wife of
being in love with a dashing Southerner. He
was a plain man himself, you know, and Adela—that
is her name—admits that he gave her
no cause for such treachery. She lays it all
to the fact of her own mother dying when she
was a child, and of her father’s lax ways of
living, and that she had never known a woman
friend whose advice could have saved her.</p>

<p>“Samson was just, but he was also merciless.
The awakening came like a thunder clap. He
cast her off and applied for a divorce, which
was given him; also the custody of the boy,
then four years old.</p>

<p>“Fearing she might attempt to steal the
child, he sent him away, and for years did not
look on his face, because it reminded him of
a faithless wife.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” breaks in the actor, “then the
mother and boy were very much alike. Your
speaking of Phœnix causes me to remember.
She reminded me of someone. I see it now.
The resemblance is marked.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>Aleck smiles.</p>

<p>He can afford to do so now, since he has
learned of the relationship between Dorothy
and the young miner. That both of them
spring from the same father. Her “sacred
mission,” is plain to him at last, for it
must have a connection with some reconciliation
between father and son.</p>

<p>That is why Craig smiles. The teeth of his
terror have been drawn, and he no longer need
worry about the possible rival who comes out
of the wild, untamed West.</p>

<p>“Later on Samson went abroad. We know
what happened to him there. He made a
strange venture into the sea of matrimony,
and, as before, drew a blank. Coming to
Chicago he entered upon the speculative business,
in which he has since become famous;
but at that time he was only a small dog, a
drop in the bucket, and unnoticed.</p>

<p>“I do not know what trouble came up.
We have believed the beautiful Georgian left
him and fled to her native land again. Perhaps
later on we may learn more about this.</p>

<p>“At any rate, it was given out that she was
dead. Dorothy believed so, and in all probability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
does so to-day. We chance to know
that Marda the Georgian lives—that she is at
the Fair, and has come for some definite
purpose.</p>

<p>“As to Adela—her life has been a sad one.
Cast off by her husband she went back to Kentucky.
She was still lovely, and it was not
long before her hand was sought in marriage
by a worthy gentleman. Investigation
brought to light the fact that in granting
the divorce to Cereal, the woman was still
looked upon as married, and forbidden to
ever again enter upon wedlock while her
husband lived.</p>

<p>“Thus Adela was forced to refuse the offer.
She taught school; her people moved West; and
she has experienced many strange vicissitudes
of fortune, yet she vowed in my presence and
in the sight of Heaven that the one indiscretion
named was the last of her life—that her
eyes were opened, her life saddened, and ever
since the day her husband put her aside she
has lived in the one hope that the time would
come when she might redeem herself in
his eyes. She has not lived in vain. Whenever
the yellow fever raged in the South, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
Adela could be found nursing the sick. She
was the angel of light in Jacksonville when
the dread scourge wasted Florida’s metropolis.
Only for her own illness she would have been
in Brunswick this summer. Her life is nearly
spent—she has consumption now—and it is the
prayer of her last days that before she goes he
may forgive her; that some opportunity may
yet arise whereby she can win that pardon.</p>

<p>“Now about her boy. Once she found
him, but dared not make herself known, on
account of the past. He suddenly disappeared
from the city where he was attending
a military academy, nor could she trace him
again; but at the town photographer’s she
found a picture of him which she has carried
ever since, no doubt to cry over in her lonely
hours, poor woman.”</p>

<p>Aleck hands over a card photograph. It is
not a stylish picture, such as our artists of
to-day produce, but faithful to the life. It
represents a young fellow of about fifteen, a
handsome, independent-looking chap, with
something of a Southern air about him, which
is heightened by the cadet suit of gray he
wears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>“This settles all doubt,” remarks Wycherley;
“it’s the young miner from Colorado,
whom we saw with Dorothy—her brother;
and at the same time I can see the poor lady
I helped out of the Hotel des Vagabonde fire.”</p>

<p>“You had your room in that tenement,
Claude?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” reddening a trifle.</p>

<p>“And all your books, your bachelor trophies,
your many comforts were lost?”</p>

<p>“Everything. My luxurious divan, my
chair, the like of which could not be found in
a Vanderbilt mansion, the wonderful oil paintings,
gems of art, the original collection of
curios which a Sypher might not despise—all
went. But, Aleck, my boy, my entire loss
didn’t exceed five dollars, I assure you.
What is that to a man who has won a million.”</p>

<p>“Ah! your speculation then was a success?”
smiling.</p>

<p>“A stupendous one. Wiped out all past
debts and have a million ahead. No time to
figure it up yet; may be a couple of hundred
thousand either way, but that is a matter of
small importance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>Craig never ceases to be amused at the
strange idiosyncracies of his queer companion.
He realizes by this time—perhaps from the
enormous dinner Wycherley is making—that
the other has no means, and it is really ridiculous
to see a man without a dollar in his
pocket declaring so carelessly that a quarter
of a million one way or the other is a matter
of little importance.</p>

<p>“One thing about this matter gives me
pain,” the Canadian says presently.</p>

<p>“You refer to Bob Rocket and his mission?”
remarks the actor, still busy with knife
and fork.</p>

<p>“Yes. He comes to arrest John Phœnix,
whom we know to be the son of Samson
Cereal.”</p>

<p>“That is unfortunate, but the young man
has embezzled fifty thousand dollars from the
mining company, and the outraged law of
Colorado must take its course. You wouldn’t
think of hindering Rocket in the discharge of
his duty, Aleck?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! far from it. At the same time, I
cannot help regretting the circumstance. It
will be a blow to Dorothy, who seems to think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
a good deal of this half brother. They must
have met before.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps corresponded. As for myself, I
am amazed at the young man’s foolhardiness.
Why has he allowed the fatal attraction of the
Fair to detain him here when he should be
across the lakes in Canada. That’s the trouble
with most men—they don’t use common sense
under such circumstances.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got more than we want of them
over in Canada. If my country should ever
become a member of your Union, which, I
grant you, is a possible thing, though I’m not
one in favor of it, there will be such an exodus
of boodle aldermen and other rascals as has
never been seen before; and no honest man in
the Dominion will shed a tear. Why, some
among us favor annexation simply to save
Canada from being the dumping ground of
your swindlers.”</p>

<p>Wycherley laughs at this, and hands his
plate to the staring waiter with an aside “a
little more of that delicious roast beef—and
be sure to have it rare.”</p>

<p>“You visit the Cereal manse to-night, I
believe, Aleck. I wonder if John will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
there. Perhaps he and his father in times
gone by have had a falling out, and Dorothy
is patching up the peace between them. Very
clever of her. She’s a girl in a thousand, and
remembering who her mother was—begging
your pardon, my dear boy, as she may yet be
a mother-in-law to you—I am amazed and
wonder where she got her sensible ways.
Then there’s Bob Rocket—I know the man
to a dot—he’ll be around, and if it should so
happen that he receives his telegram in the
midst of the festivities, he’ll arrest his man
right there. Twenty millionaires wouldn’t
awe him, nor would he respect the palace of
the Czar of Russia. With the majesty of the
law back of him he’d do his duty.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll hope that his instructions, having
been delayed so long, will continue to dally,
at least until the evening is well spent. If
Mr. Cereal is reconciled to his son, it would
be too humiliating to have the boy arrested
at his house. At any rate, I shall keep clear
of it, and for Dorothy’s sake would like to see
John get away.”</p>

<p>This absorbing topic has monopolized their
conversation thus far, but having in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
measure exhausted it, they branch out upon
other subjects.</p>

<p>At length the dinner is ended. Aleck
presses his companion to relate the stirring
scene of the previous night, and is accommodated
with a yarn that has many comical
features to it, for the actor is a genius in discovering
the ridiculous side of anything,
though Craig declares he is certain the affair
was anything but humorous to those concerned.</p>

<p>All the while the Canadian is planning as to
how he may make his friend accept a loan,
without hurting his feelings. In the end he
decides that the best way to do is to go
squarely at the matter, in a frank manner.</p>

<p>“Since you lost all you had in the fire,
Claude, you must allow me to make you a
little loan. There, not a word, sir—I shall feel
insulted if you refuse”—passing over a fifty-dollar
note.</p>

<p>Wycherley fumbles the bill with trembling
fingers. “Great Heavens, Aleck,” he says
huskily, “it’s been many a long day since I’ve
held a bill like this in my hands. It makes
me feel like something of importance. Bless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
you, my dear boy. I shall repay it if I
live.”</p>

<p>Together they leave the dining room.</p>

<p>“Try a weed,” proposes Aleck; and as he
draws the fragrant smoke Wycherley is fain
to believe his morning sacrifice has met with
its reward, heaped up and running over.</p>

<p>Together they sit in the cool rotunda of the
hotel, enjoying their postprandial smoke, and
exchanging remarks about various things of
mutual interest.</p>

<p>While thus engaged a tall gentleman with
a gray mustache, and a face on which great
shrewdness is marked, saunters past and
glances at them. Then he returns and stops.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, gentlemen, but the
clerk told me Mr. Aleck Craig was over here.
Do either of you happen to bear that name?”</p>

<p>He looks straight at the Canadian, as
though easily picking him out to be the man.</p>

<p>“That is my name, sir,” replies Aleck
quickly.</p>

<p>“I am glad to meet you, Mr. Craig. I have
a little business with you. My name is Samson
Cereal.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="chaptitle">ENGAGED.</p>


<p>It is a name to conjure with in the markets
of the World’s Fair city. Besides, this gentleman
with the iron-gray mustache is Dorothy’s
father.</p>

<p>Both Craig and Wycherley spring to their
feet. The latter smiles in a peculiar way, as
though he sees in this a heaven-sent chance to
rise. Perhaps his education in stocks, his
enormous wagering against the uncertainties
of the market, may meet a reward. Everything
comes to those who wait, is the philosophy
of this strange adventurer.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to meet you, Mr. Cereal. My
friend Wycherley, sir. I have had the
pleasure of your daughter’s acquaintance
since last winter.”</p>

<p>The elderly gentleman smiles. Aleck notes
the firm mouth under the mustache, and
believes poor Adela will wait a long time ere
she hears words of forgiveness for that error
so far back in the past, the fearful blunder
that ruined her life. Perhaps he does Samson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
Cereal a wrong, but judging from his
strong features he believes him to be a stern
man with whom justice goes before mercy.</p>

<p>“I have heard something about your meeting
up at Montreal, and my daughter has told
me certain facts that occurred last night—facts
that stamp you a hero——”</p>

<p>“Sir!”</p>

<p>“Facts that make me proud to know you,
young man. Let no false modesty cause you
to belittle the deed. I claim that when a man
takes his life in his hands and imperils it for
parties unknown to him, who may be in danger,
he rises above the ordinary plane and
becomes a hero. Let us not argue the subject
then. I am glad to meet you for your own
sake—glad to know you. Let us sit down
again. I have something to say that is of
deepest importance to me.”</p>

<p>He drops into a chair, with one of them on
either side. Both the young men show signs
of excitement, and the veteran speculator is
the cool one. Aleck is saying to himself:</p>

<p>“Dorothy has told him how she came to
know me—what can he want to see me for,”
and his bachelor heart persists in keeping up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
a trip-hammer accompaniment that is rather
singular in a man who has been born and
reared in the country of ice and snow.</p>

<p>As for Wycherley, his thoughts run about
in this wise:</p>

<p>“Here’s Samson Cereal, the great grain
operator, king of the wheat pit. Let me
study him well, since fate has decided that I
am to be in the same line. What would he
say if he knew I had plunged on the markets
and came out two million ahead on yesterday’s
deal—what, indeed? I must use my
ears—who knows but what in the course of his
everyday talk he may drop some hints that I
may seize upon, and use as a ladder upon
which to mount to future success.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Craig, am I right in presuming that
this is the gentleman who was with you last
night on the Midway?” begins the operator.</p>

<p>“We were together much of the evening.
In one sense he has as much claim upon your
thanks as myself, for only through him was I
enabled to do Miss Dorothy a service,” replies
Aleck, with the generous impulse of making
his comrade “solid” with the great manipulator
of wheat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>Samson Cereal gravely turns and holds out
his hand.</p>

<p>“Allow me, sir; I appreciate the favor,” he
says in the singularly deep voice that has
many a time electrified the swaying masses of
brokers and operators on change.</p>

<p>“You are perfectly free to speak upon any
subject, sir,” adds Aleck.</p>

<p>“That being the case, I will no longer pique
your curiosity, gentlemen. Am I right in
believing that you have through accident
learned certain things connected with a very
wretched episode in my life?”</p>

<p>Aleck’s cheeks flush under his gaze, for
somehow he feels as though Samson
reproaches him.</p>

<p>“I beg you to believe, sir, I have not pried
into your private affairs through morbid curiosity.
A peculiar chain of circumstances, link
fastened to link, one thing leading to another,
has given me some knowledge of certain
unhappy events far back in your life. I
have not sought them, and once in my
possession they shall go no further, depend
upon it.”</p>

<p>His earnest manner, his frank expression,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
serve to convince the wheat king that what he
says he means.</p>

<p>“Mr. Craig, I earnestly hope you will
never have to encounter the family troubles
that have darkened my past.”</p>

<p>Aleck secretly indorses this. It is bad
enough for a bachelor of some thirty summers
to think of being wedded once, let alone
several times.</p>

<p>“Twice have I breasted the stormy seas of
matrimony, and some fatality seemed to follow
me. Both ventures ended in my being
bereft. My first wife was a Kentucky girl.
I have sealed that book so long ago that it
may not be torn open now if I can help it.
The boy who came to me as the fruits of that
unhappy union resembled his mother so
closely in features that I could not bear to
look upon him. He was at school, a military
academy, until seventeen. Then something
like remorse came upon me. I had married
again, and my little Dorothy was more than
twelve. I believe she influenced me—God
bless the sunbeam! At any rate I sent for the
lad, and started him in life.</p>

<p>“All went well for a short time. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
another blow fell upon me. I was being systematically
robbed. In my office was a safe.
I had numerous clerks, and John was one.
Never dreaming of the truth I set a detective
on the watch, and one day he brought me his
report. It incriminated my own son. At
first I was amazed, horror-stricken. Then
my anger arose. I sent for John. He came
in smiling, for he was light of heart. I told
him deliberately what I had found out. He
turned very pale and trembled. Fool that I
was, I believed these were evidences of guilt.
Then he looked at me proudly and denied
it all. I have a furious temper, Heaven forgive
me! I upbraided him, called him names,
and even coupled his mother’s disgrace with
his downfall; declaring that her treacherous
nature had descended to him. Then I told
him to go. I remember how proudly he drew
himself up and said:</p>

<p>“'You are my father—you send me from
you without a hearing. I will go—I will
change my name and never see you again
until this blot is removed from my character.’</p>

<p>“I have never seen him from that time, but
he is in the city to-day—he will be at my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
house to-night. Dorothy did it all. Through
some woman who was nursing a poor sick
man, she received word to come to the Hahnemann
hospital, where he had been taken. She
went, and found a dying man with a confession
written and witnessed—a wretched man
who claimed to be the detective I employed.
He had found no trouble in locating the guilty
party, but being eager to make more money
had compromised with the thief and agreed to
implicate John.</p>

<p>“It seems Dorothy and John have corresponded
all this while, and she wrote him to
come on at once, telling him of his vindication.
An agreement was made to meet in the
shadow of the Ferris wheel, and hence she has
haunted that place of late.</p>

<p>“I am a stern man, but I hope a just one.
Feeling that I have wronged my boy, I am
eager to apologize, to make amends. Unfitted
for business, even on this day when of all
others I should be at my office, for I have
momentous deals on foot, I decided to step in
here and meet you, for I can assure you, Mr.
Craig, I take a deep interest in your welfare.
Perhaps you are not aware of it, but I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
several of your people up in Montreal and
Toronto, and can remember nothing but kindness
received at their hands.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it, sir. On my part I
feel it my duty to inform you that one whom
you have looked upon as dead is in Chicago,”
says Aleck, while Wycherley chuckles as he
wonders which one is meant, and then fearing
lest his ill-timed merriment may cause the
great operator to look upon him with suspicion,
he turns it off into a cough.</p>

<p>Samson Cereal fastens his eyes upon Craig,
as though he would read his soul.</p>

<p>“You refer to whom?”</p>

<p>“The lady you ran away with twenty years
ago, near the Bosphorus—the mother of
Dorothy.”</p>

<p>“Good God, man, is she alive and in
Chicago? And now I remember—<i>he</i> is here—we
met on the Midway and scowled like two
pirates. He has not forgotten—but she alive!
Then they two must be leagued to do me injury,
perhaps through Dorothy.”</p>

<p>“You are both wrong and right, sir. He
came here to execute the vengeance that has
slumbered twenty years, but knew nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
of her presence until last night, when he
snatched off the gauzy covering from the face
of the Veiled Fortune Teller of Cairo Street,
and beheld—Marda, once your wife, stolen
from his servants. I don’t know her motive
in coming here, nor where she has been all
these years, but have some reason to believe it
is the natural mother love for her child that
has brought her—perhaps she comes to stand
between Aroun Scutari and his prey.”</p>

<p>Samson Cereal reflects. He is no longer excited,
but singularly cool. When personal
danger threatens, this man can be like a block
of ice. It is this trait that has helped him
reach the front rank in his chosen profession.</p>

<p>“You speak of his vengeance—have you an
idea what he means to do?”</p>

<p>“Ah! I see Miss Dorothy failed to tell you
all.”</p>

<p>“Then suppose you supply the missing
link.”</p>

<p>“This Turk plays a game of tit for tat.
You stole his bride. Patiently has he waited
as only a Turk could wait. Now he comes
to win a bride by running away with your
daughter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>“Curse his impudence! I’ll have his life
for it! I’ll lock him up or wring his
neck.”</p>

<p>“Good enough, sir, but I’d let him get to
the end of his tether first. Give him rope
enough, and he’ll hang himself.”</p>

<p>“I expect you’re right, Mr. Craig. Pardon
my impetuosity. It’s seldom I’m aroused
like that. I wanted to make your acquaintance,
for something tells me we are fated to
see more of each other. You are coming
around to-night, of course. Bring your friend
with you. I must be off to see if that confounded
telegram has arrived.”</p>

<p>Aleck and Wycherley look at each other.</p>

<p>“He’s looking for a telegram too,” mutters
the latter; “wonder if one will come for me
from Vanderbilt or George Gould, asking me
to take charge.”</p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen, I wish you good-day.
Market’s on the rise—a little excitement—Consolidated——”</p>

<p>Wycherley clutches his arm.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me sir, it’s gone <i>higher</i>?” he
exclaims, his face elongated, his eyes distended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“Why, yes—two cents above yesterday’s
highest quotation.”</p>

<p>The actor puts one hand on his heart, and
his whole attitude is one of bliss.</p>

<p>“Aleck, my <i>dear</i> boy—do you hear that?
I had the audacity to back Consolidated again
with half my pile. It means another million
to me.”</p>

<p>“What!” roars the big operator, aghast.</p>

<p>Mr. Wycherley recovers himself, while Aleck
turns aside so that his smile may not offend
the peculiar fellow he calls friend—the warm-hearted
oddity who has in times past tried
nearly every vocation on the list, only to find
himself a round peg in a square hole, and who
is still vainly groping for his true business in
life.</p>

<p>Wycherley does not lose his usual assurance
in this moment of trial:</p>

<p>“I backed Consolidated yesterday, together
with some mining stock, and the rise boomed
me to the skies, two million or so ahead.
Indications warned me to hang on to Consolidated
longer, and I went in heavy; with
the result that to-day I am again a million
ahead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>He proudly takes out that wonderful notebook
and shows the figures that tell the
story.</p>

<p>Samson Cereal looks at the book and then
again at the owner.</p>

<p>“Who were these tremendous deals made
with, if it is proper for me to ask?”</p>

<p>“One Claude Wycherley.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know him.”</p>

<p>“Myself.”</p>

<p>Now a light begins to dawn upon the mind
of the old speculator; a grim smile breaks
over his face showing that he is amused.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see! How long have you been
indulging in this romantic pastime, Mr.
Wycherley?”</p>

<p>“About three weeks.”</p>

<p>“Faithfully every day?”</p>

<p>“Just as the market held out. I never
bought haphazard. My early experience told
me that was ruinous policy—that it was like a
game of chess—each move was but the single
play of a series—each move must have a
meaning.”</p>

<p>Again that shrewd head of the veteran wags—such
talk pleases him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>“What success have you had from the
start?”</p>

<p>“In the beginning, very bad. You can see
here I went deep in the mire. Then I began
to reason, and had gleams of success. The
second week was a see-saw, with Claude
Wycherley a million or two in the soup.
This last week everything I touched turned to
gold, and I’m three times a millionaire—on
paper.”</p>

<p>“Young men, good-day. You may come
around to my office to-morrow, if at liberty.
I have a place for you to fill. We’ll harness
this genius of yours to common-sense dollars.”</p>

<p>Then he leaves the hotel.</p>

<p>“Aleck, my <i>dear</i> fellow, catch me—I’m going
to faint. Did you hear what he said? In
a week it will read Cereal &amp; Wycherley.
Think of it, ye gods! Fortune at one bound.
I’m in the saddle at last. Good-by, follies of
the past with your haunting ghosts—welcome
a golden future; perhaps, who knows, egad,
<i>a wife</i>!”</p>

<p class="chaptitle">COLONEL BOB WAITS FOR HIS MESSAGE.</p>


<p>Ablaze with light is the palatial mansion of
the millionaire operator. Sweet strains of
music float out upon the misty moonlight,
and are lost in dying cadence upon the waters
of the great lake, that gently lap the pebbly
shore so near the stately pile.</p>

<p>All that wealth can do to beautify and
adorn the house has been done with a liberal
hand. In these days of magic all one has to
do is to press the golden button, and master
minds accomplish the rest.</p>

<p>The parlors look like fairy bowers. Green
plants and rare exotics are everywhere, and
the taste with which they are placed reflects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
credit on the decorator artist. Among these
scenes wander many of Chicago’s gallant sons
and fair daughters.</p>

<p>Dorothy as the hostess is as lovely a vision
as the eye of man ever beheld, and her father
looks the wealthy merchant prince to perfection,
though perhaps one might see an uneasy
gleam in his eyes at times, and he glances
toward the door frequently, as though expecting
someone of more than ordinary
importance.</p>

<p>The gay reception is in full swing when
Aleck and Wycherley arrive. Both are of
course in evening dress, for the ex-actor under
the circumstances has wisely invested the
loan made by his companion. As the future
possible partner of the great Samson Cereal,
he must make a creditable <i>entree</i> into society.
Besides, a dress suit is a good nucleus for a
loan at “my uncle’s” on a rainy day.</p>

<p>Once inside they make their way to where
Miss Dorothy, assisted by a lady friend,
receives, and meet a hearty welcome from
both herself and her father. If Aleck was
far gone before, his case is hopeless now, for
the young woman presents such a picture of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
feminine beauty that he is even awed to think
of his boldness in daring to aspire to win her.
Still, deep down in his heart, he secretly
exults to remember that less than twenty-four
hours previous he held all this loveliness in
his arms. Aleck is quiet, a thorough gentleman
always, and for reasons of his own he
keeps near Mr. Cereal. Knowing the secret
of the other, he feels that he has a deep
interest there.</p>

<p>As to Wycherley, he makes himself right
at home, and being introduced moves among
the guests with charming freedom. An old
traveler of his stamp can adapt himself to
either terminus of “society,” and under
other circumstances, should fortune throw
him among a herd of tramps, or into a camp
of darkies, he would be found the jolliest
fellow of them all, telling tough yarns, singing
songs, and picking the banjo. A wonderfully
versatile chap is this same Wycherley.
To see him now, as he saunters gracefully
about, one would believe him a representative
of Chicago’s highest circles, and much
curiosity is aroused as to who he may be.
His bearing, his name, both are very <i>distingué</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
and many speculations are indulged
in as to whether he is from Boston or New
York.</p>

<p>“Ah! Aleck, my <i>dear</i> boy, this is living.
Just think what fortune has done for me in a
short twenty-four hours. I believe I’m on the
highroad to success. There are many lovely
girls here, and backed by substantial dads,
but I shall not commit myself. I can’t quite
forget the black eyes of the Spanish cigar girl
at the Fair, who made such a sieve of my heart
that it would do for a housewife’s use. But
this is very pleasant, dear boy, exceedingly
so. I fancy our host looks careworn.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen that all along. It may be
anxiety about the coming of his son John,
who, as you may have noticed, has not yet
shown up.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it may be with reference to that
momentous telegram he was expecting,” declares
Wycherley, who has not forgotten.</p>

<p>“Have you seen anything of the Turk?”</p>

<p>“Jove! you didn’t expect him here—no,
you’re joking; but I have met someone I
know. What did I tell you about his ability
to get there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>“I’m in a fog, Claude.”</p>

<p>“Well, look down the room—just bowing
over the hand of Miss Dorothy—I never
dreamed <i>he</i> was a society man.”</p>

<p>“Bless me! Why, it’s Rocket!”</p>

<p>“Bob Rocket, dead sure. Listen, the old
gentleman introduces him to the banker’s
wife—she who sparkles with a fortune of
diamonds worth a king’s ransom. What
does he say?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bondclipper, allow me to introduce
an old friend of mine, Colonel Robert Rocket
of Colorado. I met him on a Western trip
years ago, when he was in the Legislature.
Our Western men are coming to the front, you
know, and I believe the colonel represents
some of these great mines you hear so much
about in the papers.”</p>

<p>“Well done for Bob! Of course his only
object in coming here is to keep an eye on
John. I only hope and pray for my part—I
mean Mr. Cereal’s peace of mind—the exposure
doesn’t take place before all this company.”</p>

<p>“It would be needless. We must, if necessary,
find some means of avoiding that.”</p>

<p>“Ah! you don’t know Bob. Just as soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
as he gets that telegram, he’ll make direct for
his man, and all Hades couldn’t stop him.”</p>

<p>“Very good. We must watch him, then.
Just as soon as a message comes, if it does
arrive, one of us—myself—must see John and
inveigle him out of the room, while you fall in
with the colonel and distract his attention.”</p>

<p>“Count on me to do my best. Both of us
are interested now in avoiding a scene on
account of our prospective relations with
Samson Cereal. There now, don’t give up,
Aleck. Ah! he comes.”</p>

<p>“Who—the messenger boy?”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! no, it’s John.”</p>

<p>The young man has entered the room. He
makes a decidedly striking appearance, for,
although not quite six feet in height, his figure
is that of an athlete. Aleck takes to him
on sight.</p>

<p>“What a shame such a young god should
have descended to the rôle of a defaulter,”
mutters Wycherley in the Canadian’s ear.</p>

<p>Aleck does not reply. He has the queerest
feeling pass over him—a flush succeeded by a
chill. It is hard to believe this fine, frank
looking man can be a fugitive from justice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
but strange things happen in this life, and we
grow accustomed to many facts which at first
seem impossible.</p>

<p>Samson Cereal goes to him, his eager hand
outstretched, his eye kindled with emotion.
They meet close to where our friends stand.</p>

<p>“My boy, is the past forgiven? I have
learned of my wretched mistake, and stand
here ready to tell you how sorry I have been,”
is what the father says in a husky voice.</p>

<p>His hand is taken in a strong clasp.</p>

<p>“Say no more, father. The past is forgotten.
Let us never speak of it again. I
have come to-night because Dorothy bade me,
God bless her! Take me to her, sir.”</p>

<p>Then they move off. The expected scene
does not materialize, but speedily it is noised
about that Samson Cereal’s son is in the room.
Few of his Chicago acquaintances knew he
had a son, and much surprise ensues; but
when John is introduced a little flutter spreads
among the fair buds and those who have been
in the market several seasons, such a flutter
as the advent of a new and very desirable catch
must always cause.</p>

<p>Aleck keeps an eye on Colonel Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>That remarkable personage seems to be
quite amused at the coming of John. He is
accustomed to seeing daring games played by
the men whom he has business with, and
there are times when he can admire the nerve
that is needed to carry them through. All the
while he keeps one eye on the door. There is
not a moment that he does not expect a message
of some sort, letter or telegram, having
left instructions behind for either coming to
his address to be delivered at once.</p>

<p>There are other elements in the game which
Aleck has not forgotten, and he is forcibly reminded
of this fact. Standing by himself in a
portion of the rear parlor or music room,
while Cereal is proudly introducing his stalwart
son to many of his friends, Aleck is positive
he hears a long-drawn sigh, and then
the whispered words:</p>

<p>“God bless him!”</p>

<p>He turns his head.</p>

<p>There is a door near by, a hallway beyond.
Someone stands just beyond this door—a
woman, wearing a white apron and a lace cap,
a jaunty bit of feathery material on top of her
gray hair. He has had one or two glimpses of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
her before, and knows she has been employed
in the rear room assisting the ladies to remove
their wraps, a sort of <i>femme de chambre</i>.</p>

<p>Attracted by the words that escaped her
lips, Aleck looks more closely at her face than
he has done before. It is changed indeed, but
he suddenly remembers that he talked with
this woman not many hours before.</p>

<p>Again he looks—her eyes meet his gaze, and
she shrinks back. He follows her, and just before
she can enter the ladies’ dressing room,
calls:</p>

<p>“I wish to see you, Adela.”</p>

<p>At the sound of that name she turns and
clasps her hands. Upon her sad face comes
a look so full of entreaty that the young
Canadian is touched.</p>

<p>“Do not mention that name again under
this roof, I beg. I admit I am the wretched
woman you talked with, but do not betray
me—I pray this by the memory of the mother
you love,” she says feebly.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="chaptitle">BY SPECIAL DELIVERY.</p>


<p>The words, the tone in which they are
spoken, and what he knows of the woman
cause Aleck to sympathize with her. At the
same time he is surprised to find her in
Samson Cereal’s mansion. A suspicion flashes
into his mind that perhaps she is here for no
good purpose, but he immediately dismisses it
with scorn.</p>

<p>“What brings you here—I feel as though I
had a right to ask?” he says.</p>

<p>“A double reason—my desire to see my
boy, for he is mine even though the cruel law
took him from me—and the longing that for
one night I might be under the same roof that
shelters them both. Once in the long ago we
made a happy family. O God! that Satan’s
hand came between! Years of atonement
have followed—will suffering never wash out a
sin like that? But I forget myself—I vowed
I would control my feelings if I came. You
will not betray one so wretched?”</p>

<p>“Not for worlds. But you must tell me
how you managed to gain access here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>“I know his housekeeper. She was a nurse
in the hospital when I was head nurse, and she
owed me some gratitude. When I asked this
favor she readily granted it, though of course
utterly ignorant of my motive.”</p>

<p>He has not forgotten what she declared
was her hope—that Heaven would give her
a chance to prove her love, her repentance,
before the grim Destroyer, who had fastened
upon her, came to claim his victim.</p>

<p>Thus he is assured that she will do no harm,
though he can hardly believe she is wise in
enduring the melancholy pleasure of gazing
upon forbidden fruit.</p>

<p>“Have you met him?” he asks, curious to
know whether Samson Cereal could suspect.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! but I am utterly unlike the Adela
he married in the long ago. Besides, these
glasses which I carry give me a different
look.”</p>

<p>She puts them on, and Aleck admits he
would not have known her.</p>

<p>“He failed to recognize you, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I trembled a little, for he looked at
me steadily with those stern eyes; but believing
me to be dead years ago, he did not suspect.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
Oh, sir! imagine my feelings in this
house, where but for that one fatal indiscretion
I even now might be the proud and happy
mistress. God give me courage and strength
to warn others to avoid the rocks upon which
my life was wrecked.”</p>

<p>“Amen!” says Aleck solemnly, for he
feels as though he is in the presence of a
priestess.</p>

<p>She turns and leaves him, as some ladies
need her assistance. Aleck reflects upon the
strange combination of circumstances that
have been grouped amid these scenes of pleasure
and beauty. The guests move about, singing
takes place, with occasional gentle serenades
by the company of musicians hidden
among the palms and ferns; and none of them
even suspect what an undercurrent of human
tragedy is occurring beneath the placid surface.
Apparently all is mirth and good cheer;
people nowadays do not carry their hearts on
their sleeves. The swan is said to sing as it
dies. Brave mariners on the stormy deep go
down with colors flying. So, in this day of
sudden changes, men have laughed and joked
merrily over yawning financial graves, taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
the old saying to heart, “Let us eat, drink,
and be merry, for to-morrow we die.”</p>

<p>Will a thunderbolt drop from this clear sky
and bring consternation among those present?</p>

<p>Again he observes Samson Cereal and notes
a certain fact. His son has come, and everything
passed off well, yet the look of concern
is still upon the father’s face, and he glances
ever and anon in the direction of the door,
as though he longs for yet dreads the coming
of <i>something</i>.</p>

<p>Surely this man cannot fear the Turk.
Aleck shakes his head negatively at the
thought. There is something of the lion in
the operator’s make-up. He was a soldier in
the war—a young captain at the time he fell
in love with the Kentucky girl, Adela; and his
reputation has always been that of a brave
man. Many a time has he met the masses on
the financial battleground, and rolled back
the mad assault with the strength of his
will. This is hardly the man to fear Scutari
at home, when he braved the powerful pasha
upon the latter’s own ground. Something
else worries him, of which Aleck is ignorant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>He puts two or three things together and
then readies a decision.</p>

<p>“I believe it is the expected telegram.
Perhaps he has big issues at stake. The life
of a speculator is not all rose-colored, I can
see,” the Canadian mutters.</p>

<p>By and by Aleck chances to run across the
man from Colorado, who greets him with the
warmth that is a part of his nature; and the
hand-shake that follows is marked by unusual
vigor.</p>

<p>“No need of my asking why you are here,
Colonel Rocket,” he says meaningly.</p>

<p>“Well, you understood what brought me
from Colorado. Business is business with me.
I knew Cereal, and took advantage of a
former meeting to call, when he asked me to
drop in. I’m not in the habit of wearing
these duds, you see; and privately, between
you and the gate post, Mr. Craig, I rented out
this suit from a costumer; but my life has
taken me among all classes of men, and I’m
pretty much at home wherever I chance
to go. Quite a swell gathering here, and
I reckon there’ll be a dandy spread to top
off with. What d’ye think of him any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
way?” with a crook of his thumb over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Do you mean our host?”</p>

<p>“The deuce, no! It’s John.”</p>

<p>“He makes a fine looking gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Correct, Mr. Craig! Now I’ve had a long
experience, and you can bet I’ve seen some
strange ones in my day, but I give you my
word for it I’ve never set eyes on so smooth
a customer. Why, he’d fool the keenest of
’em. His face bears the stamp of honesty.
Reckon that’s how he came to have such a
good chance to rake in so big a pile.”</p>

<p>“Colonel, have you ever known mistakes
to occur in such things?”</p>

<p>Bob Rocket turns his eagle eye upon the other.</p>

<p>“Certainly I have—why?”</p>

<p>“Might it not be possible under these circumstances?”</p>

<p>“Hardly! You saw the picture yourself,
and you can see he owns to the name of
Phœnix—at least they call him John.”</p>

<p>“Of course I know little or nothing about
the many secrets of your business. My only
guide is the reading of character on the face,
and I admit that is very deceptive.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, you have much to learn, sir. It’s
been a business with me to study human
nature since I was knee high to a duck. I’d
be glad, for the old gentleman’s sake, if his
boy turned out innocent, but there’s about
one chance in fifty of its happening.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of Phœnix reminds me of something.
It had slipped my mind before.
There’s a young fellow in Chicago from your
region who seems to know him.”</p>

<p>“That information might be valuable to me,
under certain conditions. Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Bless me, the only name I heard him give
was Happy Jack!”</p>

<p>“Not very much to the point.”</p>

<p>“He is stopping at the Sherman House. I
met him last night on the Midway under
peculiar circumstances,” and Aleck proceeds
to relate the adventure near the western exit,
when the Turk and his hired myrmidons attempted
to carry off a daughter of Chicago.</p>

<p>“Come, I’m interested in Happy Jack.
From the words he dropped while in that
stupid state it’s plain he’s a Western man; a
miner, I reckon. Knows John Phœnix, does
he—I may yet have to call upon him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
identify my man, so that I can get the necessary
requisition papers. I’ll just make a note
of the fact—always jot ’em down—memory
might confuse things. There, that settles it
beyond all question. Folks must think we’re
making a trade. Such things are allowable in
the house of a big plunger like Cereal, eh?”</p>

<p>The sheriff from Colorado laughs in a good-natured
way, as though he enjoys the joke;
but somehow Aleck has found a new matter
upon which to ponder, an idea that opens up
an avenue the end of which no man can see.</p>

<p>“We’ll wait and see how you turn out, colonel.
Meanwhile I’ve written something on
this piece of paper—I put it in this envelope
and sealed it up. There, place it in your pocket.
Now, when the crisis of your game occurs,
open this and see how near the truth I’ve
come.”</p>

<p>“Quite a clever idea. I’ll do it, by Jove.
Here comes some of the ladies, bless ’em!
Won’t leave me alone—Cereal been telling
some of my adventures and making out I’m a
Buffalo Bill sort of a dashing hero. All I
want is to keep my man in sight. Only for
him and duty, <i>how</i> I would enjoy this 'ere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
racket. Ladies, your servant. What can I
do for you?”</p>

<p>The Colorado sheriff bows with the grace of
a Chesterfield, and a chorus of feminine voices
arises:</p>

<p>“Oh, Colonel Rocket, Mr. Cereal has just
been telling us about the time you rescued a
lovely maiden from the Indians who raided
the border. He was unable to finish the
romance and sent us to you. What became
of Mary?”</p>

<p>The colonel’s eyes twinkle.</p>

<p>“Oh! she married a worthless scamp out in
Denver afterward, and I reckon has been sorry
for it ever since,” he says nonchalantly.</p>

<p>A chorus of indignant exclamations arises.</p>

<p>“It was a shame—after you risked your
life to save her!”</p>

<p>The colonel, as they flit away like a bevy of
butterflies, turns to Aleck and adds dryly:</p>

<p>“Mary is my wife.”</p>

<p>At this the Canadian bursts out laughing.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you say so, then?”</p>

<p>“Ah! I’ve cut my eye-teeth, Mr. Craig.
So long as they believe me a bachelor there’s
a halo of romance around my head, no matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
how homely I may be. Once stamp me a
married man, and I’m left to amuse myself—the
glamour is gone. Now, my private affairs
have nothing to do with these giddy young
rosebuds, and I don’t care to have my family
under microscopic examination. Hence my
silence.”</p>

<p>Aleck falls to musing.</p>

<p>“Wycherley would say you were right.
At least I could depend on him until to-night,
but he seems to have turned over a new leaf,
and there you have him cutting a heavy swell
with the banker’s daughter, and playing the
devoted. Jove! he’s the most remarkable of
men.”</p>

<p>“Quite a clever fellow, and you can bet I’m
ready to yell myself hoarse if success comes to
him. I wanted to see him on the top wave.
He deserves it all. The little sister who is
now living with my wife and family never
forgets to pray for Claude Wycherley.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think he’s on the road to success,
for Samson Cereal has taken to him, and
means to utilize some talent he has for reading
between the lines of stock quotations.”</p>

<p>“I see—feeling the pulse of the market as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
it were. Pardon me, every ring at the bell
attracts my attention. I must keep an eye
on the door. The colored footman opens it.
Eureka! a messenger boy with a note. He
refuses to deliver it over. Wise chap—long
head! Such important matters ought only be
given to those they’re meant for. My telegram
has arrived. Now we’ll know what’s what,
and be able to wind matters up. Ah, there!
my colored friend, lead him this way, that’s
right. Here I am. Colonel Robert Rocket
of Colorado,” and with a broad smile of
pleasure, and an eagerness he cannot disguise,
the Western sheriff holds out his hand for the
message.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="chaptitle">THE FALL OF THE MIGHTY OAK.</p>


<p>The small uniformed myrmidon of the telegraph
company stands in front of the big
Western sheriff, and holds the message
behind his back.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he asks immediately.</p>

<p>“The one you’re looking for, I reckon—Colonel
Robert Rocket.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>“Say, kin you read, boss?” demands the
boy, a sharp-faced chap.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, a little,” returns the other,
frowning, for he is impatient to receive his own.</p>

<p>“Then just cast your eyes on that 'ere
enwelope, from a distance like, an’ tell me if
you kin make Bob Rocket or Davy Crockett
or any other firework show out o’ it.”</p>

<p>Plainly he reads the name of Samson
Cereal, and the address below.</p>

<p>“The devil! I made a mistake. Boy,
follow the nigger. It aint for me—<i>yet!</i>” And
the sheriff falls back out of the way, a little
ruffled, but still on deck.</p>

<p>Aleck has heard it all.</p>

<p>He knows that while relieved from one
source of anxiety, another has shown its head.
What reception will the great speculator give
this message? True, he must often receive
telegrams on many important subjects, but a
man of his firmness would not show this
intense anxiety over a matter unless it was of
the utmost moment.</p>

<p>Naturally, therefore, Aleck, being decidedly
interested, moves in the direction of the big
operator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>By this time Samson Cereal has caught
sight of the colored door-keeper leading the
sagacious messenger boy to his quarter. The
latter takes it all as a matter of course. There
can be seen no trace of amazement on his face,
though the decoration of the rooms is superb,
and the toilets of the ladies charming. One
of these imps would strut through the palace
of a Czar with the indifference of a princeling
to the manner born.</p>

<p>Now he addresses the lord of the manor,
and puts to him questions regarding his
identity that soon establish the fact.</p>

<p>“Put her on that 'ere line—an’ the time.”</p>

<p>Cereal hastily signs his name.</p>

<p>He realizes that a number of people are
watching him curiously, and with a great
effort maintains his self possession. His wonderful
nerve serves him well in such an emergency
as this. As if the matter is of little
importance he thrusts the message unopened
into his pocket and goes on chatting with the
gentleman at his side.</p>

<p>“Well done!” says Aleck in admiration,
for his eyes can see that the other is eager to
get at the message.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>Presently Craig misses him.</p>

<p>The library is at the back of the house. He
has been in it before during the evening.
From the open windows one can look out
upon the lake, and the scene in the misty
moonlight is one to conjure up all manner of
romance. Moonlight, the gentle undulations
of water, and love seem to go hand in hand.</p>

<p>To this quarter Aleck bends his steps, wondering
if the operator went thither. The door
of the library is open, and, looking in, he sees
Samson Cereal. The operator is alone. He
stands under the gas jet, and has with trembling
hands torn the end from the little buff
envelope.</p>

<p>He draws out the inclosure, and then, as if
unable to look at it, drops his hand. This
weakness is but momentary. With a harsh
laugh he finally raises his hand, and his eyes
take in the contents of the message.</p>

<p>Aleck sees him stagger back and clap a
hand across his forehead, while to his ears
float the words—how sadly they sound,
with that soft music swelling from the retreat
near by:</p>

<p>“Lost—everything lost! After all these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
years of building up, to be ruined now. Good
God! I shall go mad—mad!”</p>

<p>When a man of his caliber gives way under
a severe strain, there is a terrible danger of
his mind going. Aleck Craig once studied for
a doctor, and realizes the desperate nature of
the situation. The operator has apparently
forgotten all about the fact that his mansion
is filled with guests. Upon his mind weighs
the one terrible thought of ruin. It glares at
him from the walls in malignant letters—everywhere
he sees in letters of fire the awful
word that is seared upon his brain.</p>

<p>A proud man Samson Cereal has been. Up
to this time he has been very conservative,
and small-sized panics have passed him unharmed.
This summer’s dullness in trade has
tempted him to make a break in a direction
whither he has never before trod. By degrees
he has gone in deeper and deeper until
everything that he has in the wide world is
risked; and this during a time when, owing
to the public alarm, one cannot raise a thousand
dollars on securities worth twenty times
the amount. Instead of diminishing, the old
man’s agitation seems to increase. He staggers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
as he walks, and then suddenly drops
into a chair, where his chin falls upon his
breast. Such an attitude of dejection Aleck
never before looked upon.</p>

<p>He remembers that it is his duty to tell
the children of this man that Samson Cereal
may be dying there in his chair. Heaven
knows he looks about as much like a dying
man as the human mind could conceive. A
tragedy seems imminent, and yet Aleck feels
that the fact should not be made known if it
is possible to keep it a secret. These people
have come here for pleasure—why then should
they be disturbed in their search for it. They
have no especial interest in Samson Cereal, beyond
the fact that he is rich and gives entertainments
that it is an honor to attend. The
speculator may sink out of sight and his disappearance
create but a slight ripple on the
sea in which he swims.</p>

<p>Aleck has some such idea as this in his
brain, as he gently closes the library door,
and moves away to find the son and daughter.</p>

<p>Somehow the gay scene has lost all its attractions
for him. He can remember only the
agony he has seen depicted upon the face of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
the man in the library—the man who wrestles
with the pent-up feelings of his soul, now
bursting their barriers and flowing over.</p>

<p>Among the guests he sees Dorothy, and as
he looks upon the fair vision he hates himself
because necessity compels him to bring pain
to her. If it were possible he would shield
her—that is the thought that flashes into his
mind, and it proves how far the young Canadian
is gone in the realm of love.</p>

<p>Now he catches her eye and makes a quick
motion with his hand. She seems to understand
and, leaving her friends, comes up to
him. Upon her face is a look of inquiry—perhaps
even a shade of alarm. Of course her
first thought is in connection with John.</p>

<p>He knows curious eyes must be upon her
most of the time, and desires to protect her.</p>

<p>“Miss Dorothy, can you be brave to take a
sudden shock without showing these people
that something has happened?” he says
quietly.</p>

<p>There leaps into her eyes a swift gleam of
alarm. Then she realizes what he refers to
and seeks to avoid—pride comes to the rescue.</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe so, Mr. Craig. Tell me what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
has happened. It is something terrible, I
know, for your face is so very sober. John——”</p>

<p>“No, it is your father, Miss Dorothy.”</p>

<p>He has with some diplomacy managed to
turn her back toward the good people who fill
the room. The music, one of Schumann’s weird
creations, rises and falls in sobs and strange,
almost unearthly sounds, until it seems to
Aleck the elements have united in mourning
over Samson Cereal’s downfall.</p>

<p>“Tell me the worst, I can stand it. See, I
have more courage than you give me credit for,
but for Heaven’s sake be quick!”</p>

<p>He realizes that there is need of haste, for it
must be agony to her, each second’s delay.</p>

<p>“Your father has received a telegram—it
must have contained news of a distressing
character, for I found him in the library, giving
way to his emotion and speaking of being
ruined.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is terrible, Mr. Craig! My poor
papa!”</p>

<p>“I understand that you would hardly care
to have these people eye-witnesses of the scene,
and so I closed the door. Then I sought you
and looked for John.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>“Let us go to him at once. If there is suffering
I should share it with my poor father.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” says Aleck wisely, “we had
better look for your brother.”</p>

<p>It pleases him to look upon their relationship
in this light. Once he felt the pangs of
jealousy when thinking of this same young
miner. Then again, at the mention of John’s
name, a sudden regret flashes into his mind.
He remembers that there is also a sword
hanging over him, liable to descend at any
moment—a sword in the hands of Bob
Rocket, who waits for final instructions, unaccountably
delayed, before arresting his man.</p>

<p>Surely a cruel fate has conspired to bring
about this crisis on the very night when
gayety abounds in the speculator’s mansion.</p>

<p>Dorothy realizes the wisdom of his words.
Whatever he may seem to Aleck, who has the
privilege of reading between the lines and
looking behind the scenes, to her John is a
bulwark of strength, and in a crisis like this
can be depended on.</p>

<p>As luck will have it the object of their
search is near at hand, and catching his
eye Aleck beckons. When John joins them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
he is told in a few brief sentences what has
occurred.</p>

<p>They approach the library door, but Colonel
Rocket, not willing to lose sight of his man
even for a minute, saunters after.</p>

<p>Upon opening the door they discover the
old speculator with his head lying on both
arms, which are thrown upon the table. He
does not move, does not apparently hear their
entrance. His manner is that of one entirely
given over to despair. It would be difficult
indeed to recognize in this bowed, broken
figure the bold speculator whom previous
storms have failed to bend. When the sturdy
oak goes before the tempest, it is with a
mighty crash.</p>

<p>Aleck closes the door. He would lock it,
but finds no key. Dorothy has already flown
to the side of her father, and drops on her knees.</p>

<p>So long as he lives Craig can never forget
the picture thus presented—the fair girl
dressed in her exquisite reception robes, a
princess by right of beauty, kneeling there
and fondly stroking the silvered head of the
old wheat king.</p>

<p>“Dear father, what is the matter? Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
terrible trouble has come upon you, some
crushing sorrow. I am your child, your
Dorothy. Let me share it with you—confide
in me, dear.”</p>

<p>She fondly pats his head while speaking
thus, just as though it were a child she addressed.
The speculator looks up. His face
is very, very white, and lines of pain show
upon it, but through this he smiles, oh, so
sweetly, as his eyes fall upon the fair face so
near his own.</p>

<p>“My dear girl, I thank God I secured an
annuity for you some years ago. That at
least is saved. I have received bad news—the
worst that could have happened has arrived,
and I am afraid, my dear girl, that your father
is—a ruined man!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="chaptitle">SAMSON CEREAL AND SON.</p>


<p>Unseen by any of them the door has opened
a trifle. Colonel Bob’s curiosity has been
aroused by such singular happenings, and he
is determined to see for himself what it means.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
He has some idea that John is connected with
the business—that perhaps his father’s telegram
was from the authorities or some friend
in Denver, telling the sad facts of John’s
downfall, and it behooves the sheriff, under
these conditions, to keep a keen lookout lest
the young man should give him the slip.
After going to such trouble it is hardly his
policy to let John escape, not if a dozen receptions
have to be broken up.</p>

<p>So Colonel Bob posts himself by the door to
hear what is said, and his quick intuition tells
him the true state of affairs.</p>

<p>John has held back while Dorothy attempts
to arouse her father, but at the mention of
the word “ruin” he can restrain himself no
longer.</p>

<p>“What does this mean, father? I think
that I have a right to know,” he says, bending
over his despondent parent.</p>

<p>Samson Cereal raises his eyes wearily.</p>

<p>“Ah! it’s you, John. Yes, you are my son,
and you have a right to know. The markets
have been so infernally dull, with no business
in the country, that in order to keep myself
going I looked up some new sources of speculation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
and had such wonderful faith in them
that I went in deeper than I knew, it being
my object to get the control of the company.
Majority rules, and the minority can be frozen
out.</p>

<p>“Lately it has taken everything I can raise
to meet my liabilities. I knew a crisis was at
hand. One man remained to be bought. His
name is Dickerson. He owns the controlling
share. Nominally it is worth five hundred
dollars. My agent has him cornered in St.
Louis, and was instructed to offer him five
thousand for his share. I have hoped he
would not know that he held the balance
of power. But the other parties are after
him, and the keystone, without which my arch
is useless, is placed far beyond my reach.
Read that telegram—read it aloud, John.”</p>

<p>The young man takes the message:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dickerson offered forty thousand cash by the syndicate.
Has under oath promised to deliver me his share,
provided fifty thousand is telegraphed him by noon to-morrow,
the fourteenth. Otherwise it is lost. Answer.</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Max.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>“And at this time I could raise fifty million
as easily as that many thousand. I’m tied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
hand and foot. If it could be done the control
of a very rich property would be in my
hands, but without it the syndicate will dictate
terms, and I am ruined beyond all hope.”</p>

<p>“But cheer up, father. Surely you do not
need despair. You have weathered storms
before,” says John cheerily.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! many of them; but I always had
an anchor to windward, and knew the nature
of the holding ground. Now I am at sea,
with the storm dashing over my doomed bark.
All is lost but my honor—that, thank God, no
man can rob me of!” And the crushed
speculator raises his head a little after his
proud manner of yore, but it is only a momentary
movement, for he quickly falls back into
the same despondent attitude as before.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me you have no
friends who would loan you that amount?”
asks John.</p>

<p>“That only shows how little you Denver
people appreciate the stringency of the money
market. In all my years of business I never
saw anything to compare with it. My friends
couldn’t assist me if they would—they are all
about as badly off as I am, and staggering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
under a heavy load. There is no help under
heaven for me—I must go down.”</p>

<p>To a proud man of great business tact, who
has carried the standard of his house successfully
for nearly twenty years, this is indeed
the most bitter hour of life. No wonder some
men have been so crushed that they never
arose again.</p>

<p>“See here, father, you forget me,” says
John, laying a hand with some tenderness on
the shoulder of his parent.</p>

<p>“In what way, my boy?” asks the speculator,
almost dreamily.</p>

<p>“I may be able to assist you, sir.”</p>

<p>Aleck starts at the words—he wonders what
they mean. Does John intend to give up his
ill-gotten gains in order to save his father?
That would be a singular thing indeed. Besides,
Craig is enough of a business man to
know it would not hold—that if the young
man from Denver is arrested the funds he has
embezzled must be seized, no matter in whose
hands they happen to be at the time.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he is greatly interested by the
intensely dramatic nature of the situation, and
watches the three actors, who, engrossed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
their own affairs, have entirely forgotten his
presence. Dorothy, with her hands clasped
before her, is surveying the other two, her
eyes, filled with unshed tears, fixed upon
John, as though his words have filled her
with a sudden hope.</p>

<p>As for the speculator he raises his hand
and places it on John’s, but there is no change
in his despondent attitude. Only a convulsive
movement running through his frame tells of
the rush of emotion. This boy whom he so
cruelly wronged loves him after all. It may
be remorse that eats Samson Cereal’s soul.
God knows!</p>

<p>“John, my boy, you are kind, but I know
it is only done to cheer me up. I shall get
over this, perhaps, but the shock has well-nigh
unsettled my reason. Give me time to
brush these cobwebs from my mind,” says
Cereal soberly.</p>

<p>“That might be too late. Whatever is
done must be done at once,” remarks John
firmly.</p>

<p>He speaks with such an air of authority in
his voice that the great operator raises his
head, and draws a hand across his eyes. Used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
to depending wholly upon himself, this experience
of having a staff to lean upon is
something new.</p>

<p>“I like to hear you talk like that—it
reminds me of what I have been in business.
No difficulty was too great for me to attack
and conquer. But this terrible summer, was
its like ever known? Firms in which I had
the most implicit confidence have gone under,
and each one dragged me lower, until this last
demand finishes all. Your intentions are
good, John, but unless you are a wizard and
can make fifty thousand dollars grow on a
tree, I see no escape”—sadly, still patting the
hand that rests on his.</p>

<p>John smiles, and Aleck groans—groans
because he has been able to peep behind the
scenes and see what dénouements are in store.
It is just as though he has read the concluding
chapter of the novel first, and knows all
the while, no matter how ardent the love
scenes, that Edmond never marries Juliet,
who dies before the happy consummation of
their vows; and having this previous knowledge,
he cannot take the interest in the thrilling
scenes that would naturally be expected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>“Father, you forget I am no longer a boy—that
I have spent years in the West, where
fortunes are made and lost even more rapidly
than in Chicago. If fifty thousand dollars
will be of use to you——”</p>

<p>“John—reflect, boy!”</p>

<p>“I can put it at your service, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good God! don’t arouse any false hopes,
my dear boy—a second shock would kill me,”
says the old speculator, struggling out of his
chair and standing there with one clenched
hand upon the library table, a picture of intense,
strained eagerness. Every eye is glued
upon the face of the man from Denver, who
smiles in a way that is reassuring.</p>

<p>“I am making sure of what I say, sir, and
I repeat it. Circumstances enable me to offer
you the amount you need. Will you
accept?”</p>

<p>“Now—do you mean at once?” asks his
father.</p>

<p>“At any time. I can get you the money as
soon as business opens in the morning. It can
be wired on to this man in plenty of time to
secure you the deciding share.”</p>

<p>“Dorothy, are you there, child?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes, father. What can I do for
you,” flying to his side so eagerly.</p>

<p>“Pinch me, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father! what can you mean—are you
losing your mind?” she cries, aghast.</p>

<p>“No, no; but it seems too good to be true;
I must be dreaming. So pinch me and I can
tell by the pain if I am asleep or awake. If
this be a dream, I hope I may never arouse.”</p>

<p>She playfully complies with his request, and
the manipulator of wheat utters an exclamation.</p>

<p>“There, there, child, that is quite sufficient.
I know now it is a reality,” rubbing his arm
vigorously, and then adding; “but, John, my
boy, you understand me—this money I will
only accept as a loan at ten per cent., unless
you would rather go into this business with
me. The street is so terribly dull that I have
decided to branch out as manager in a great
concern. That can be settled later on, however.
It would please me to have my son
associated with me. This shock to-night has
taught me that my nerves are not so much like
steel as they once were.”</p>

<p>“Father, you are better now?” asks
Dorothy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>“Better? why, of course I am. Dr. John
has given me a dose that is bound to cure.
I shall soon be myself; but it was a horrible
experience, and I feel like a man who has just
aroused from a nightmare, trembling and cold.
I can see now where Providence worked in
this matter; and to you, more than anyone
else, my dear daughter, is due the praise.”</p>

<p>“It makes me happy to know that things
have come out so well. I believed John could
be depended on to show his real affection for
you if the time ever came,” returns Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Tell me, do they—our guests—know that
something of a shock has come to me?” he
asks, smoothing his heavy gray hair with his
fingers, an old habit of his.</p>

<p>“I do not think so,” remarks Aleck.</p>

<p>“Ah! you there, Craig? Pretty tough,
such an experience to a man of fifty, but
there’s a gleam of sunshine through it all, for
I have learned one glorious fact, that my children
love me.”</p>

<p>He looks proudly upon them, as they stand
there one on either side. It is indeed a
revelation to this singular man who has led
such an isolated life, wrapped up in business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>“Depend upon it, sir, 'there’s a divinity
that shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we
will.’ Behind this there is some purpose
which sooner or later will be made manifest.
I saw you here, in abject misery, and guessing
the cause, managed to get your son and daughter
in without attracting attention. It might
be well for all of us to go out among the guests
again. Some whisper may go around, and in
these times men are quick to seize upon the
slightest suspicion and magnify it.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Mr. Craig. I am ready to
go. If anyone mentions that I look pale, tell
them I have had a little attack of—well, heart
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Before we go, father, let us decide this
business.”</p>

<p>“The morning will do, John.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, the morning might be too
late. My habits have become set in this way—I
would get out of bed to carry an idea to
completion.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say, John—I am guided
entirely by your wishes in this matter,” says
the speculator, but his eyes twinkle in something
like their old-time way—this resolute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
manner which John assumes tickles him immensely,
for he awakens to the fact that his
son is no longer a boy, but capable of managing
any business.</p>

<p>“The message says fifty thousand. I have
been careful not to get tied up during this
period of financial panic, and happen to have
that amount in one of your Chicago banks at
this moment. The easiest thing to be done
under such circumstances is for me to sit right
down at this desk, where everything seems so
very handy, and make you out a check for
the amount. Luckily I have a blank one with
me. To save time I would, if I were you,
send a message to-night—<i>now</i>, to your agent,
telling him to close the deal.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say, John. I confess my
head is slightly rattled to-night—it shall
be as you suggest,” and he proceeds to write
at the table on the back of the message he
had received.</p>

<p>Finally John jumps up.</p>

<p>“There you are, father,” handing him a
check. “We will arrange the minor details
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“It is all right, John—you have saved the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
old house of Samson Cereal—God bless you,
my boy!”</p>

<p>But it is far from being all right as yet, and
Aleck realizes this when he hears the library
door suddenly pushed back.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="chaptitle">AN ACCOMMODATING SHERIFF.</p>


<p>Turning his head at hearing the door open
Aleck sees one whom he knows, and a cold
chill passes over him as he recognizes the face
of the Colorado colonel.</p>

<p>Bob Rocket steps into the library and closes
the door behind him. This action of course
attracts the attention of all concerned, and
the Western sheriff finds himself the cynosure
of inquiring eyes.</p>

<p>John’s hand is stayed in the very act of
handing the check to his father—the smile
remains on Dorothy’s face, and as for the old
speculator, he looks with displeasure upon the
interloper.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, gentlemen, ladies,”
says the other in his bass voice, speaking very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
slowly and methodically, “but a stern sense
of duty compels me to break in upon your
family party.”</p>

<p>“Duty, Colonel Rocket!” exclaims the
speculator, turning red with rising wrath.</p>

<p>“That was what I said, sir. Duty with me
must always rise even above the courtesy a
guest owes to his host. You were kind
enough to invite me to your house to-night,
Mr. Cereal, and it served my purpose to
accept. I have passed a pleasant evening. I
thank you for it. But, sir, that shall not
stand in the way of my fulfilling the mission
which brought me to Chicago.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!”</p>

<p>“And has even taken me to this house.”</p>

<p>“Rocket, have you been too often at the
sideboard?” asks the great operator, frowning.</p>

<p>“You see yourself, sir, that I am not under
the influence of liquor. My hand is as steady
as a die. I am sorry for you, Mr. Cereal—doubly
sorry for this charming young
lady——”</p>

<p>“Hang it, Rocket, why mince matters?
What the devil <i>do</i> you want here?”</p>

<p>“I’m coming to it gradually, sir. Don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
want the shock to be too severe. In the first
place you don’t know, because I failed to tell
you, that at present I am a sheriff out at
Denver.”</p>

<p>“A sheriff!” repeats Dorothy uneasily.</p>

<p>“Denver, eh?” says John, arching his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“I have been sent to Chicago on the track of
a shrewd young scoundrel who has absconded
with over fifty thousand dollars in funds.”</p>

<p>“My God!” groans the old operator, for the
striking similarity in the sums causes him to
have a sudden horrible suspicion, which he
endeavors to tear loose and cast away.</p>

<p>Aleck darts a quick glance at John, and is
surprised to see that the young man simply
flushes a little under the meaning words of the
sheriff.</p>

<p>“The company that was so neatly robbed
has offered me five thousand dollars for the
capture of the thief, and double that if I save
the funds. I am here in the interest of the
great Hecla Mining Company.”</p>

<p>At this John changes his tactics—silence,
contemptuous silence, he maintains no longer,
but utters an angry exclamation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>“You say the Hecla, of Denver?” he demands.</p>

<p>“Those were my words, young man. It has
been kept dark until this chase could be
brought to a successful termination. I had
hoped to lay low until receiving an answer to
a message I sent, but circumstances combine
to force my hand. Mr. Cereal, my dear sir, it
pains me to do this thing, but duty leaves me
no choice. You cannot cash that check, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” demands John quietly.</p>

<p>“Because the money it covers is the property
of the Hecla Mining Company.”</p>

<p>“Granted it was once, but is so no longer,”
continues this remarkable young man, and
Sheriff Bob secretly confesses that he never
before ran across so collected a customer.</p>

<p>“O John!” cries Dorothy, taking his
words for open confession and defiance.</p>

<p>“My son, explain this thing,” says the
operator, again resting his weight on the table.</p>

<p>“My dear father, be calm. You do not see
me at all excited. I am entirely innocent of
this charge, and can afford to laugh at it as a
good joke. I assure you solemnly, there is
nothing to fear,” the young man says, disturbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
by the visible agitation of those who
are near and dear to him.</p>

<p>As for Rocket, he merely humps his
shoulders, and keeps both hands behind him
under the spiked tails of his dress coat. His
manner is in a measure contemptuous, for he
believes in his case, and that the young man
simply plays such a bold game as would be
natural to one who had succeeded in making
a clever haul of fifty thousand.</p>

<p>Turning upon the sheriff, John asks:</p>

<p>“Will you answer a few questions, sir?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! provided I can do so in the line
of professional duty,” drawls the deep bass.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. Tell me first of all the
name of the defaulter.”</p>

<p>“Cheerfully—John Cereal, known in Denver
as John Phœnix.”</p>

<p>Again the two near by utter moans of grief,
but John, who has more at stake than anyone
else—John, who is thus boldly accused of a
terrible crime—simply smiles and nods.</p>

<p>“I thought so. You don’t know as much
about this case as you supposed, Mr. Rocket.
I give you the benefit of the doubt, and
believe your work has been caused by a blunder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
and not malice. In the first place, I am
John Cereal. In Denver I have always been
known as John Atherton, because that is my
middle name. The Phœnix you speak of
was my confidential secretary, and I am
amazed and grieved to learn that Jack has
gone to the bad. There are men in this city
who know me—when the morning comes I
shall have little difficulty in proving, even to
your satisfaction, sir, that I am John Atherton,
President and Manager of the Hecla.”</p>

<p>At this Samson Cereal takes courage and
raises his head again. He is just in time to
see the sheriff draw something out from his
inner pocket, which he holds up.</p>

<p>“Do you see that? Would you call it a good
photograph of one John Phœnix?” he asks.</p>

<p>“Not much. That is my counterfeit resemblance.
I kept it in a drawer of my desk,
and I remember Jack’s was there too. See
here, Mr. Rocket, do you mean to tell me
someone in the office sent you that picture
and said it was Phœnix, the defaulter?”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what was done, sir,” replies
the sheriff, not quite so confident as he
was, though keeping a sharp lookout for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
tricks. He has a constitutional uneasiness
about rogues who are playing big games.</p>

<p>“It was a miserable blunder, and inexcusable.
They could not have discovered it as
yet, or a message would have been sent explaining
matters. Now, my dear colonel,
let’s be reasonable in this matter. To create
a disturbance at this time in my father’s
house would be inexcusable—damnable, sir.
I am anxious to avoid a scene. When the
guests are gone I will room with you where
you will, and when morning comes it will be
my turn to prove my identity, after which an
apology must be in order from you, sir. I
am not at all disturbed by your accusation.
In my other coat I have letters, various things
to show you who I am. Look at this ring
with the monogram J. A. C. Then here is
my watch marked the same way.”</p>

<p>“The devil! this seems an odd thing, I declare,
but I’m a martinet when it comes to duty,
and until you prove your innocence, nothing
remains for me but to believe you guilty. You
understand it—this photograph is my authority;
if it proves false, I’ll willingly apologize.
Until then you must be—my prisoner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>“Very good! We shall laugh at this joke
in less than ten hours. Father, send your
message, and depend on me that it’s all right.
Were it twice the sum I could raise it in an
hour after the banks open. Someone down in
Denver will have to pay the piper for this outrageous
blunder. That a picture of Phœnix!
Why, hang it, we’re as much opposites as you
and I, Colonel Rocket, and in disposition too.
I am quiet, sedate, while I doubt if in all
Denver, or the West, you could find a jollier
fellow than Happy Jack.”</p>

<p>Aleck Craig gives a cry.</p>

<p>“What was that name?” he demands
hastily.</p>

<p>“We usually called Phœnix Happy Jack,
on account of his rollicking ways,” returns
John.</p>

<p>“Wonderful!” murmurs the Canadian.</p>

<p>As for the colonel, his red face glows with a
sudden zeal. His manner reminds one of the
setter quivering with excitement, upon scenting
the game close at hand.</p>

<p>“Craig, tell me, wasn’t that the name of
the gay young dog who was with you last
night? When you related that adventure a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
while ago, I’m dead certain you called him
Happy Jack, and that he said he knew
Phœnix?”</p>

<p>“Just so, colonel, and unless he’s flown
you’ll find him at the Sherman House.”</p>

<p>“Good Heavens! was ever a man so beset?”</p>

<p>“What now, Rocket?” asks John, smiling.</p>

<p>“Too much of a good thing. I feel like the
poor devil who was undecided which girl to
marry, and who in his dilemma sung: 'How
happy could I be with either, were t’ other dear
charmer away.’ I’ve got my hand on one
party, and the other is at the Sherman House.
If I leave one I may lose both, and a bird in
the hand’s worth two in the bush.” John is
the coolest, most unconcerned man in the
house. He actually laughs.</p>

<p>“Poor colonel!” he says.</p>

<p>“Perfectly heartless! Young man, what am
I to do under these distressing circumstances?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ll accompany you to the Sherman.
Perhaps Jack will break down and confess
the truth when he sees me. We can get out
without attracting attention, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Oh! brother John!”</p>

<p>A rap comes on the door, which Aleck opens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“Beg pardon—is Colonel Bob Rocket
in here?” asks the colored door-keeper.</p>

<p>“On deck, parson. Has <i>it</i> come?”
demands that worthy.</p>

<p>“De messenger boy, sah.”</p>

<p>Rocket snatches the envelope and tears it
open. Then he says something under his
breath.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cereal, this explains it—John Atherton,
pardon my bothering you, and kick this
ass who signs himself 'Jim,’ when you see him
again, for sending me the wrong picture.
Gentlemen—ladies—adieu. Duty calls me
from this realm of bliss—believe me, only that
could tear Bob Rocket away so near supper
time. To the Sherman, then, and Happy
Jack! Again I say, <i>au revoir!</i>”</p>

<p class="chaptitle">HAPPY JACK!</p>


<p>Thus he bows himself out, this strange
Sheriff Bob. For once at least he has made
a serious blunder, and almost precipitated a
most unseemly disturbance. No wonder he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
wrathy over the blunder of the Denver clerk
who could so carelessly send a photograph
without examining it, and almost cause the
arrest of his own employer.</p>

<p>After he has gone the little party in the
library draw together again. John is good-natured,
as he can well afford to be. Conscious
of his innocence, he has at no time felt
anything beyond mere annoyance.</p>

<p>As for Aleck, he has a feeling of positive
relief that amounts to delight. The heaviness
of spirits is gone. Not only is John what he
has professed to be, but the load that has
weighed the old speculator down is gone.
Dorothy smiles through her tears, Dorothy is
happy, and this raises the mercury of Aleck’s
thermometer several degrees.</p>

<p>Samson Cereal is quickly becoming his old
self, though perhaps an inquiring eye might
discover that something has occurred to upset
the usually stern and self-possessed king of
the wheat pit.</p>

<p>The dramatic scene has shifted the setting of
the stage, and the actors too appear to have a
different look. Instead of tears and woe there
are smiles and rejoicing. No one misses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
Colonel Bob, since his mission was to uphold
the majesty of the law, and they can put him
away from their minds without trouble.</p>

<p>Again they speak of mingling with the
guests, as the absence of all belonging to the
household may be noticed and commented
upon, but it seems as though some peculiar
fortune persists in interfering with these
plans.</p>

<p>They hear voices outside the door, and
Aleck finds his attention riveted when someone
mentions his name.</p>

<p>“I must see Aleck Craig! It is very important.”</p>

<p>“Wait,” says another voice.</p>

<p>Then there is a knock at the door—not a
timid rap, but one that means business.
Aleck is closer than any of the others, so he
takes upon himself to open it.</p>

<p>It is Wycherley. Another figure stands
behind him which has a familiar look.</p>

<p>“Ah! my dear boy, here’s a party who
wants to see you. Nothing I could do would
put him off. He says it’s very, very particular.
The easiest way to get rid of him was to bring
him in, and here he is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>With that he stands aside, and the man
who has kept in the background steps briskly
up. Aleck can hardly believe his eyes.</p>

<p>“Happy Jack!” he exclaims.</p>

<p>Of all the singular happenings of this night
it surely takes the lead. Where did he come
from, and what does he want with Craig?</p>

<p>The Canadian recovers himself quickly, as
he sees an outstretched hand before him and
hears the young roysterer say:</p>

<p>“Bound to find you, Craig. Heard at the
Sherman you were here. Obstacles no object
in my way, and here I am.”</p>

<p>“Come into the library. Such a weighty
secret as you carry should not be bruited
around into the curious ears of the public.
Closed doors would be more in keeping for
it,” says Aleck.</p>

<p>He has not the remotest idea what the other
may be at, but discretion is a part of his
character, and it strikes him that under the
circumstances he had better get the defaulter
into the library.</p>

<p>If he has business of importance with him,
then the precaution will be well taken. On the
other hand, it may prove that he has followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
out some hair-brained scheme, and considers
it a joke to return a pocket knife or some
such article, which Aleck may have lost, and
which he is determined to deliver to the owner.
Such jokes appear smart to men who have
looked upon the wine when it is red. They
make much capital out of them.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances as these the Canadian
athlete believes he has a trump card to
play. Once the door is shut Happy Jack
may not find it so easy to get out again.</p>

<p>He manages to give Wycherley a wink and
a nod which that individual rightly interprets,
and he also enters the room, remaining with his
back against the door, thus serving as a barrier
to ingress or escape.</p>

<p>One thing Aleck notes. John has turned
his back upon them the very instant he
heard the name of Happy Jack mentioned; so
when that individual enters the room he does
not know, after his sweeping glance around,
who is present.</p>

<p>Happy Jack has one trait that in times past
has served him well. This is assurance that
would well become a New York alderman.
Nothing appears to daunt him. Put him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
down at Her Majesty’s reception, and he
would do his little part after his own way, if
not quite to the Queen’s taste.</p>

<p>He is not clad in a dress suit, but this fact
has no weight with him. Happy Jack
Phœnix in his business Scotch cheviot is perfectly
at home even amid the satins and
diamonds of the finest reception Chicago has
seen during the season.</p>

<p>“Mr. Craig, you will, I know, pardon my
boldness in hunting you down, when you learn
the reason for such a move. Singular man at
all times. When I get my mind set on anything
all earth and the lower regions—beg pardon,
young lady—can’t persuade me otherwise,”
he says, as placing both hands on the
back of a chair he faces the Canadian, beyond
whom are Cereal and his daughter, both looking
in open-eyed wonder at this uninvited
guest.</p>

<p>“That’s so!” mutters John, and he has had
good reason in the past to lament this trait
which Jack mentions.</p>

<p>“Eh! did anyone speak? Well, as I was
saying, Mr. Craig, I’m set in my way. I can’t
be turned aside. If I was walking along a railroad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
track and an engine came at me, there’d
be trouble, and two to one it wouldn’t be me
that suffered. That’s my nature. Now, fortune
threw in my way certain information. It
concerned a gentleman whose acquaintance I
formed last night. I said to myself, 'Happy
Jack, not a wink of sleep for you until you see
him and put a flea in his ear.’ That is why I
am here. I have brought the flea with me.</p>

<p>“You wonder why I go to all this trouble
for one almost a stranger. It pleases me. I’m
always doing something for others—expect to
become a philanthropist after sowing the last
of my wild oats. Then, there’s another reason.
My friend, the way you sent that rascally
Turk spinning last night won my heart.
Something of a gymnast myself in a small
way, a believer in the manly art of self-defense,
and I said to myself: 'The chap who
can give a fellow such a whirl takes my heart.’</p>

<p>“Pardon this long but necessary digression,
as the fellow in the novel says. Now, having
made myself solid, I’ll come down to common
horse sense, and talk business.”</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” mutters John, still keeping
his back toward the newcomer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>Phœnix glances sharply toward him, as if
his ears have caught this last remark, and then
he throws an inquiring look at Craig, who
smiles and touches his forehead in a meaning
way which brings a knowing expression on the
other’s face.</p>

<p>“A little off, eh? That’s all right—no
offense taken, I assure you. Now see here,
Mr. Craig, when you tossed that copper-colored
Turk over to me last night on the
Midway, like a bundle of rags, you thought
that was the end of him—that he was out of
the game. I know you did, but you never
made a greater mistake in all your life, sir.</p>

<p>“I have made a study of these vagrants of
the Midway. Was a tramp myself once and
can understand their ways, you know. Queer
people, the Turks, and their leading characteristic,
sir, is <i>revenge</i>. Even a lapse of twenty
years will not make them forget.”</p>

<p>This may be an accidental thrust, and probably
is, but it strikes home. Samson Cereal
starts and looks anxious, feeling that he has
some concern in this game.</p>

<p>“As I wandered about that entrancing
region early this evening, my ear charmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
with the sweet music of the never ceasing tom-tom,
or the cry of the bum-bum candy vendor,
my eyes feasting on the beauties of Samoan
and Lapland architecture, I chanced to catch
a glimpse of the Turkish nabob. Ever since I
had that whirl at him last night I have been in
low spirits. I wanted to repeat it. If no one
got in the way I believed I could even see
your throw and go one better.</p>

<p>“So it entered my mind to follow the Turk
and watch for a chance. Gentlemen, behold
the working of fate! I dogged his steps.
Presently from the gorgeous Turkish village
he sought the classic shades of Cairo Street,
where I was quite at home.”</p>

<p>“I could swear to that!” says John, but
having been warned, the narrator of the Modern
Arabian Nights pays no attention to this
interruption beyond a shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>“It was a question with me, I assure you,
whether I should hire a donkey and run Mr.
Turk down, or mount a camel and chase him
the length of the street, for you see my animosity
was aroused. Then I began to notice
that he was holding mysterious confabs.
First he met two fellows just outside the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
Turkish barber shop and handed over some
money. Then, further down the street, two
more turned up.</p>

<p>“By this time I believed a conspiracy was
on foot to loot the Midway. A man could
retire for life if he did that. I resolved to
save the Fair, no matter what the loss of time
and money was to me; and, gentlemen, under
certain existing circumstances of which you
are not aware, I assure you the former weighed
more with me than the latter.”</p>

<p>“Don’t doubt it!” from John.</p>

<p>“Having made up my mind to sacrifice my
own interests to those of suffering humanity,
I set to work eavesdropping. Now, my education
as a detective has been woefully scant, but
in my peregrinations before condescending to
settle down in Denver I have had some rough
experiences, and they taught me how this
thing must be accomplished.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, with me it was <i>veni, vidi,
vici!</i> for I came and saw and conquered.
Near the group lay an old blanket used on
one of the camels during the wedding procession.
Under this dirty cloth of gold I hid
myself, and then edged along until I was close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
behind the conspirators. I happen to have remarkable
ears—you notice they stick out like
a rabbit’s—they give me the power of catching
a whisper, and these chaps were so earnest in
discussing their sweet plot that they talked
right out in meeting.</p>

<p>“Fortune blessed the brave—their delightful
conversation was carried on in English,
pigeon English as we men of the border would
call it. It happened that two of those present
were not Turks, but Americans, and that is what
saved me from listening to a jargon of heathen
talk that would have been a blank to me.</p>

<p>“Piece by piece I put their sentences together;
at first, sir, it was a puzzle, but as
each section filled a gap I finally found I was
handling as masterly and bold a scheme as
was ever hatched on American soil.”</p>

<p class="chaptitle">WHAT THE OLD CAMEL BLANKET CONCEALED.</p>


<p>“Happy Jack” knows enough of dramatic
rules of rhetoric to pause after this climax.
He changes his posture, thrusts one hand into
the breast of his coat, <i>à la</i> Napoleon, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
the other emphasizes his words with pointed
and quivering finger. Taken in all, he makes
a fine study. Those present, realizing that
the fellow really has something of importance
to tell, listen with attention, and this gives
him courage to pose as might a Cicero addressing
the Roman courts of old.</p>

<p>“I have not had the pleasure of being introduced,
sir, but I take it that you are the
lordly host of the manor, Samson Cereal.
Glad to see you—happy to have been of service
to your daughter last night—delighted to
meet you now, for it is against the king of the
wheat pit the Turk’s arrows are directed.</p>

<p>“He’s a good hater, I knew that as soon as
I set eyes on him; and it would make your
flesh creep to hear him tell the many things
he would do to wipe out the past, if ever he
caught one Samson Cereal on Turkish soil.
That is not to the point, however. They
settled down to business after a while, and we
had it all.</p>

<p>“Now pay attention, friends, and I will
tell you what is in the wind. This vendetta
of Cairo Street aims to carry out the will of
a master mind. Against two persons the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
grudge is held, one of them our Canadian
friend, who has interfered with the nabob’s
plans in several ways, the other King Cereal
himself.</p>

<p>“I learned that one of the men was in your
employ, sir, and you may recognize him by
the name of Anthony, which I heard him
called.”</p>

<p>“The rascal, the traitor—and I have done
so much for him!” says the operator angrily.</p>

<p>“Never mind. He is an ungrateful dog,
and the Turk’s gold bought him. I understand
that you expect a friend or two here to-morrow,
and have arranged to show them the
Midway in the evening, as they are especially
interested in the foreign countries or something
in that line; didn’t bother my head to
catch the particulars. Well, sir, these fellows
have got it in for you and Craig. The trap
will be set and baited, and before another day
dawns on Chicago, Turkish vengeance wins.</p>

<p>“This is to be brought about by strategy,
gentlemen, in which a woman figures whom
the said Samson Cereal has long believed dead.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention her again,” says the operator,
turning deathly white, and thinking of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
Dorothy, who must hear every word; but although
the sudden warning causes Phœnix to
be more guarded in his speech, what he has
already said has aroused a curiosity in the
mind of Dorothy that will grow rapidly, until
it brings her in at the grand climax.</p>

<p>“In palmy days of yore, before I took to
tramping in order to see the undercurrent of
life, I used to be a shorthand reporter, and
my old tricks of the trade cling to me still.
Under that miserable old camel blanket, with
a gleam of electric light coming in at a hole, I
did some of the tallest scribbling of my experience,
jotting down whatever seemed of importance.
Lo, the result, messieurs, of that
enterprise!”</p>

<p>He takes from his pocket a notebook, and
shows page after page of scribbling, the
strange hieroglyphics of the stenographer.
The lines awry and the characters often
faulty, but, considering the peculiar circumstances
under which it was written, the work
is rather creditable to the scribe.</p>

<p>“A little out of practice, I fear, gentlemen,
but on the whole I reckon you can have it
easily written out into everyday English.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
Between these covers lies a story as thrilling,
as weird as any I ever read in <i>Puck</i>. It will
a tale unfold to harrow up your soul and
make your blood run cold.</p>

<p>“This, then, I leave as a legacy. Hire some
poor hungry devil of a shorthand writer to spin
the yarn. My word for it, you will be amply
repaid. I would dearly love to undertake the
task myself, without hope of reward, but two
things prevent. I always hated rendering into
prosy English the poetic signs of shorthand.
Then again my time is limited in this romantic
city by the lakeside. I am uneasy—like the
Wandering Jew I find no rest, but must cross
the border to Canada’s domain. An important
engagement necessitates my leaving on the next
train. Hence, you will excuse me if I retire.
Aleck, my dear boy, always remember you
with pleasure. Look you up in Montreal if I
settle there. Reckon I’ll make a good Canuck
in the end. Mr. Cereal, yours to command.
Young lady, proud to have served one so
lovely. As to you, sir,” addressing the party
who still persists in keeping his back turned,
“if you will step outside with me, where we
run no chance of disturbing the elements of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
this charming gathering, the question of your
right to break upon my narrative with insulting
grunts that are significant of contempt will
speedily be settled,” and with this explosive
shot the man from Denver takes a step toward
the door.</p>

<p>“We can settle the whole business right
here and now, Phœnix, my boy,” says John
suddenly.</p>

<p>At the sound of that voice, together with
the mention of his name, Happy Jack whirls
around, uttering a sharp cry. John’s back is
no longer toward him—they look into each
other’s face. Phœnix is terribly stricken. As
if by magic the jaunty air leaves him, his knees
quake, and his whole appearance is that of a
man upon whom a thunderbolt has descended
without the slightest warning.</p>

<p>“Good God! John Atherton—here!”</p>

<p>“Why not—my father’s house. The question
is what brings you here—you whose duty
lay in faithful service while I was away. Ah,
Jack! your eyes fall. I was terribly mistaken
in you. We know all. Colonel Bob Rocket,
a sheriff from Denver, left this house not more
than fifteen minutes ago. He wants <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>The young man’s appearance has undergone
a terrible change. Sudden fear sets its stamp
upon his face. For days he has kept this
panic away from his mind by continual libations,
so that he has been in a hilarious condition.
Without warning the mask drops and
he finds himself face to face with the man who
has trusted him. All is known. The end is
at hand—the terrible termination that generally
winds up such cases as his. Before his
eyes looms up the penitentiary or perhaps the
dreadful fate of a suicide.</p>

<p>Caught!</p>

<p>No wonder his head hangs in shame—no
wonder he dares not meet the eye of the man
he so basely deceived.</p>

<p>“Jack, how much of that money have you
squandered?” asks the president firmly.</p>

<p>“Less than a thousand, sir.”</p>

<p>Jack seems to feel compelled to talk, even
against his will. He has been accustomed
to manifest the deepest respect for John
Atherton.</p>

<p>“Have you the rest of it with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Let me have it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>He acts like one in a dream, taking out a
roll of bills and handing it to Atherton.</p>

<p>“You may not believe me, sir, but I’m
really glad it’s off my person. The temptation
came; like a fool I yielded, and I’ve had not a
minute of peace since. Now, do with me what
you please. I deserve no mercy.”</p>

<p>“Jack, you have a mother.”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, sir, don’t remind me of
that! It’s the thought of her that’s set me
almost crazy. My ruin will kill her,” and a
shudder convulses his frame.</p>

<p>If he had only considered his mother more
before starting into this ugly business, he
might have avoided the disgrace.</p>

<p>Atherton is in a position to be lenient.
Besides, he has always had a great interest
in the young man.</p>

<p>“Have you anything left, Jack?” he asks.</p>

<p>“A few dollars, I believe, sir,” fumbling in
his pockets, as if to chase the fugitive pieces.</p>

<p>“No, no, I didn’t mean that. Here is one
hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“Sir?” gasps Phœnix.</p>

<p>“I may be compounding a felony, but I’ll
take my chances of that. Leave this city and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
cross over, as you intended, to Canada. There
endeavor to be a better man. This will all be
hushed up, and your mother need never know
of it. I do this, Jack, my boy, to give you a
chance to redeem yourself.”</p>

<p>At this Phœnix breaks completely down,
his form shakes as great sobs rack his frame.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Atherton! what a vile wretch I
have been to abuse your confidence. A man
never had a better friend than you have been
to me. How can I ever thank you enough for
giving me this chance. In her name, my poor
mother’s, I bless you. Yes, I will go to
Canada, and in the sight of Heaven I swear
that if I live to threescore years and ten nothing
can ever tempt me to fall again. This lesson
has taught me I am not made for a rascal;
my peace of mind demands that I have a clear
conscience. Would you condescend to shake
hands with me before I go, sir?”</p>

<p>“Willingly, Jack; and if you can show me
a year from now what you have done—if you
can prove to me that this lesson has sunk into
your heart, I’ll give you another trial, Jack.”</p>

<p>“God bless you, sir. You will hear from
me if I live.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>Unable to say another word the young man
turns and leaves the library. If any of the
guests see him as he quits the house, their
curiosity must be aroused by his manifest
signs of emotion.</p>

<p>“There will be one disappointed man in
Chicago, I warrant,” says Aleck, whose eyes
are moist.</p>

<p>“You mean Bob Rocket. I can fix the
matter up with him. In that case it’s only a
question of dollars and cents. Under the circumstances
I feel as though I had made a wise
move. Almost the entire sum recovered, and
poor Jack given a chance to redeem himself.
What a strange fatality led him to this place
to-night. It was probably a fortunate thing
for him, as the colonel by this time would
have had hold of him.”</p>

<p>There is much that Wycherley does not
understand, but he is not in a position to ask
questions, so he guesses how things have
gone. Aleck is relieved in several ways.
There remains one more cause for speculation—the
presence of Adela under this roof.
Will she continue to keep her presence a
secret from the man who was once her husband?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
Seeing her boy must indeed be a
source of mingled joy and grief, since, yearning
to make herself known, she dares not for
fear of being repulsed.</p>

<p>If the opportunity comes, he means to see
her again and find out if something cannot be
done to ease her last steps through life, for
the end is not far away—Aleck is enough of a
physician to read that in the hectic flush on
her cheeks.</p>

<p>They pass out among the guests. At the
first opportunity Aleck tells Wycherley about
her presence here, and that worthy is surprised,
but knowing her story, soon grasps
the situation. Can anything be done to aid
her cause? They hardly dare approach the
stern old man with the story, not being able
to hazard a guess as to how he will take it.
Something they have not counted on takes
a hand in the game—the same power that
brought Jack Phœnix to the house where his
employer chanced to be—that peculiar combination
of circumstances known as Fate.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="chaptitle">HER ATONEMENT.</p>


<p>The strains of music from the hidden
orchestra rise and fall to the time of a popular
march. No longer the low serenade or the
sad sweet lullaby that falls like the rippling
of running water on the ears of those who converse,
but the strong, joyous marching music
that means in so many words, “get your
partner and advance upon the food that has
been prepared by the first caterer of the
World’s Fair City.”</p>

<p>Double doors glide open and a royal spread
is disclosed, as only a millionaire can afford in
such tight times. There is the usual delightful
bustle; a dozen seem imbued with the same
thought, and seek out Miss Dorothy only to
find that the “young wooer from over the
border” has been too quick for Chicago, since
she is already at the head of the line, with
Aleck Craig at her side.</p>

<p>The feast is a jolly time. Light of heart are
those present. The hard times give them no
occasion for worry. Not once does a soul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
present, in the midst of this abundance, cast
a single thought upon the thousands who see
the coming of fall and winter with dread
because that they have no work.</p>

<p>These butterflies of fashion know little of
corroding care. The value of the gems sparkling
upon the persons of millionaires’ wives
and daughters at Samson Cereal’s reception
would keep food in the families of all Chicago’s
poor for a twelvemonth.</p>

<p>At last the feast is over, and they repair
again to the brilliant drawing and ball rooms
where there is to be singing and dancing.
What remains of the night will be passed
thus; and, as is usual, the last stragglers cannot
be expected to go until the small hours of
the morning.</p>

<p>Aleck would under ordinary circumstances
have gone long before, but somehow he cannot
tear himself away while others remain.
Nor can he understand what it is that chains
him unless it is love that fills his heart. It
begins to appear a very serious business, and
Craig takes himself to task several times
about it.</p>

<p>The company has dwindled down to a few,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
and Aleck resolves upon leaving. Wycherley
has gone, actually seeing a banker’s daughter
home like the audacious fellow he is.</p>

<p>Craig has promised to come around in the
morning and help translate the tale Phœnix
left behind him in shorthand—which is to
disclose the intended plans of the wily Turk.</p>

<p>Feeling very much at peace with himself
and the world in general, Aleck is descending
the stairs after having donned his light overcoat,
and secured his hat, when there rings
through the house the sudden shriek of a
woman.</p>

<p>He knows that it comes from the ladies’
dressing room, and without losing a second
makes a dash in that direction. On the way
he overtakes Samson Cereal, and together the
two push through the door into the apartment.</p>

<p>What they see is an appalling spectacle!</p>

<p>There has been a fire in the grate, for the
night air is chilly, and society ladies are not
too warmly clad. How it happened no one
may discover, but Dorothy in passing must
have gone too near, and her train swept into
contact with the fire. At any rate she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
ablaze almost in a flash, her light drapery
burning like matchwood.</p>

<p>Not from her lips did that shriek issue, for
sudden fright palsied her voice; but the
attendant gave the alarm; she, regardless of
her own safety, threw herself bodily on the
lovely young girl and beat out the fire with
her hands.</p>

<p>In this she is successful, but the flames communicated
to her own clothes. She throws
Dorothy from her, just as the gentlemen
rush in through the doorway.</p>

<p>Aleck takes in the situation at a glance.
He snatches up a costly rug from the floor.
Without a second’s delay he throws this
around the blazing form and effectually extinguishes
the fire. She looks into his face, and
Aleck is amazed to see so little fright there—indeed,
he imagines he can detect a smile
upon the countenance of the poor lady.</p>

<p>As for Cereal, he has rushed to his daughter
and stamps upon the still smoldering train.</p>

<p>“Great Heavens! Dorothy, tell me, my
darling, how did this happen—are you
injured?” he cries.</p>

<p>“An accident, father. I am not hurt in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
least, but I might have been burned to death
only for her devotion, her bravery. Oh! I
fear she has been dreadfully injured! Leave
me—go to her, father. I will send for Dr.
Edison, who has just gone home.”</p>

<p>Relieved of his sudden fears, and with a
spasm of gratitude welling up in his heart,
Samson Cereal turns to the woman who at the
risk of her own life has saved his daughter.</p>

<p>She looks him in the face now; it is the
first time, for hitherto she has not attracted
his attention. As he looks he seems to be
electrified—carried back nearly thirty years
and face to face with the romance of his youth.</p>

<p>“Good God! Adela—you!” falls from his
lips.</p>

<p>Suffering intense pain as she must be, the
divorced wife still smiles.</p>

<p>“Ah, Samson! I have prayed for this hour,
when Heaven would let me wipe out the past.
I have saved her for you, this lovely child
whom the greedy flames would have ruined
for life. God has heard my prayer. I have
not long to live. Welcome death, now!”</p>

<p>Then she swoons.</p>

<p>The old man is thoroughly aroused. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
will not even allow Aleck to carry her over to
the bed, but raises the slight form himself.
God alone knows the rush of holy feelings
that sweep over him as his arms encircle this
fragile body, once as dear to him as the apple
of his eye. They see his tear-dewed eyes
and must guess the rest.</p>

<p>He places a tender hand upon her brow and
smooths back the white hair. John has
come in, after seeing a young lady home, and
as the old man notices him he beckons.</p>

<p>“My son,” he says brokenly, “the story of
the bitter past can no longer be withheld from
you. There is your mother!”</p>

<p>Amazed, John falls on his knees beside the
bed. The poor woman opens her eyes and
looks up in his face, startled, frightened.</p>

<p>“My poor mother!” John murmurs—he
does not comprehend beyond the one fact that
she suffers agony. Out from the rug struggle
the poor burned hands and clasp him in a
fierce embrace as though she would never let
him go again. For years her heart has
yearned for him, yet fear of his reproach has
kept her aloof. Now the pent-up emotion of
a lifetime breaks forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>Her lips move as if uttering a prayer, and
then exhausted nature again causes her to
swoon.</p>

<p>The doctor comes and drives them all from
the room save Samson and the housekeeper,
who is a trained nurse. All the guests have
gone but Aleck, and with John he sits in
the deserted parlor, talking, while Dorothy
changes her dress upstairs.</p>

<p>John is feverish with impatience, and, as
best he can, Aleck tells him the sad story of
the past. It causes him intense agony, but
the depths of his heart are stirred with love
for the poor mother who so bitterly paid the
penalty the world exacts for a single sin.</p>

<p>When Craig describes with enthusiasm how
his friend Wycherley saved the poor woman
from the burning tenement John is running
over with gratitude toward the actor. Indeed,
all of them have pretty much the same feeling
for him.</p>

<p>Then Dorothy joins them, looking very
sweet, Craig thinks, in her dark robe, though
the color has left her cheeks, and a look of
sadness and fear haunts her eyes.</p>

<p>While they talk in subdued tones Samson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
Cereal joins them. His face is not as of old—the
stern lines are softened, the eyes tender.
It is with a trembling hand that he draws
Dorothy into his embrace.</p>

<p>“It was a narrow escape, my darling. Only
for her heroism you must have been lost to
me. I hardly know what to say. God in his
goodness has, I trust, forgiven me. This is the
way he has chosen to open my eyes. Adela
sinned, and it was right that we should part,
but I have been wicked to keep alive in my
heart the elements of bitterness and anger,
instead of forgiving the wrong of the past.
Now the scales are removed and I see my
lamentable fault. Her last days shall be
passed in peace,” he says brokenly.</p>

<p>“Oh, father! is she then fatally burned—has
she given her life for me?” cries Dorothy.</p>

<p>“It is not that, my child. Her burns,
though of a painful nature, are not fatal; but
she is the victim of disease—consumption has
claimed her for its own. God knows how it
was contracted; perhaps through a lack of
the necessaries of life, or it may be through
nursing those who suffered from that terrible
disease, for she tells me she has been a nurse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
in the hospitals, and through several yellow
fever epidemics down South, trying to wash
out her sin by doing good. The doctor has
told me that she cannot live through another
winter. Dorothy, shall this home be hers to
the end?”</p>

<p>“A thousand times, yes, father; and it shall
be my pleasure to wait upon her as though
she were my own mother.”</p>

<p>John in the fullness of his heart draws her
toward him and kisses her reverently.</p>

<p>“God bless you, sister,” he says brokenly;
while her words have caused Aleck to suddenly
remember the fortune teller of Cairo
Street and wonder what part she will have in
the last scene of this strange play, the dramatic
climax arranged by the wily Turk.</p>

<p>“John,” says Samson Cereal, “you have
heard this sad story from our good friend
Craig. Do you hate me for the part I have
played in it?”</p>

<p>“No, no, father. I can imagine your painful
position. I blame no one. It is, as you
say, a sad thing, indeed. The only way now
is to forget the past.”</p>

<p>“That is right, John, you speak sensibly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>“And endeavor to make my poor mother’s
last days as easy as may be. She erred, but
she has nobly atoned for the past. Let us not
judge lest we be judged.”</p>

<p>“How is she? May we not see her, father?”</p>

<p>“Here comes the doctor. He has made her
as easy as possible. Ask him!”</p>

<p>The physician can see no harm in it. He
has given her a sleeping potion, but knows
that a glimpse of happiness will do even more
to bring ease of mind; so, with a warning, he
grants them permission.</p>

<p>Aleck takes his leave. He shakes hands
with each in parting, for it seems to him he is
in some way affiliated with these good people,
since circumstances control his destiny and
places it side by side with theirs. Perhaps he
squeezes the small hand Dorothy places in
his; at any rate she blushes beautifully at
the words he says, so low that other ears hear
not, and when he has gone, glances smilingly
at the mark upon her finger made by the setting
of a ring, which is ocular proof regarding
the warmth of a Canadian handshake.</p>

<p>Craig is as good as his word. At the hour
appointed he appears at the house of the great
grain manipulator. John meets him at the
door and welcomes him, but is on the way
down town to attend to some important business
for his father connected with the deal
that has given the operator new life.</p>

<p>“I thought I saw our friend the sheriff
down on Clark Street, aboard a car,” Craig
remarks, at which the other smiles.</p>

<p>“Yes, he was here. I had a long chat with
Bob, and he starts home to-night satisfied.
He put in the night watching the Sherman,
but of course Phœnix never turned up again.
By this time he is in Canada, if he caught that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
late train. I will be back in an hour or two.
Stay to dinner.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” returns Aleck, mentally deciding
to await an invitation from Dorothy or her
father before committing himself.</p>

<p>“You’ll find father in the library, I believe;
walk right in, Craig, I must be gone.”</p>

<p>Aleck knows the way. That library will
never be forgotten by him, since the strange
occurrences of the preceding night.</p>

<p>But Mr. Cereal is not there. On the contrary,
as Aleck opens the door and enters, he
finds himself in the presence of Dorothy—in
tears. This, of course, confounds him; no man
knows how to act under such circumstances.
Bold enough to face any danger, the hero feels
weak in the presence of a weeping woman.</p>

<p>She looks up and sees him, then smiles
through her tears; it is like the April sunshine
peeping out amid the clouds, and Aleck can
mentally see the rainbow of promise.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Craig! how silly I must appear
in your eyes; but want of sleep and nervous
exhaustion have made me hysterical,” she
hastens to say, holding out a hand, then
quickly withdrawing it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>“I trust nothing further of a serious nature
has happened,” he remarks anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, no! She is getting along nicely.
Father is at her side much of the time. He
has forgiven all and is eager to make her
happy. She knows the end is not far distant,
and you would be surprised to see how contented
she is. I doubt whether in the whole
of Chicago to-day you could find a woman
so happy as Adela. It is because she is going—if
she had to live she would fear for the
future. The future seems bright and heavenly
now to her, poor Adela.”</p>

<p>“And you are crying over her woes! Ah,
Miss Dorothy! you have seen little of this
world’s sorrows. All around they lie, but the
loving care of your father has kept you free
from them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have been reflecting. It never came
to me before. Adela’s sad story has shamed
me. From this hour, Mr. Craig, I am resolved
to be of some account in the world. I grow
sick at heart to think that I have lived nearly
twenty years and never have I gone out of my
way to minister to the sick, the suffering.
This poor woman has been an angel. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
has taught me a lesson. I will tell father you
are here, Mr. Craig,” she says, possibly anxious
to escape from his observation after the
recent scene.</p>

<p>Presently Samson Cereal appears. He has
not slept all night, and at his age such things
show. His eyes look red, but his face is
cheerful. Aleck fails to discover the stern
lines of old. Perhaps the barriers to his
heart have been overthrown by the strong
rush of sympathy, and he is humbled with the
discovery that all these years he has been
bitter toward a helpless woman, striving with
might and main to retrieve the past.</p>

<p>“Ah! Craig, my dear fellow, you’re on
time. Glad to see you. Seems to me your
destiny is strangely interwoven with that of
my family, and even now I am forced to call
on you for counsel, perhaps assistance.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! I shall be happy to continue the
pleasant relation that a strange fortune has
brought about between us. In what way can
I serve you, Mr. Cereal?”</p>

<p>“It concerns that notebook placed in
my hands by Jack Phœnix. The fellow
is good at heart—his actions prove it, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
I am glad to know John gave him another
chance.”</p>

<p>“You want me to translate it into long
hand? I’m somewhat out of practice, but
in all probability I can get the sense of
it all.”</p>

<p>“I anticipated you there, Mr. Craig.
Chancing to know a smart stenographer who
lives down on Superior Street, I sent word to
him early this morning, and he came to see
me. Half an hour’s time reduced the jumble
to sense. There were a few things he could
not make out, but on the whole Jack Phœnix
did admirably, considering that he worked
under such disadvantages. I have it written
out, but can tell you briefly in narrative shape
what these men have discovered, and the plan
they have arranged to satisfy the old Turk’s
crazy desire for revenge.”</p>

<p>“That will answer just as well, and save
time,” replies Aleck, seating himself.</p>

<p>The operator produces a box of prime
Conchas.</p>

<p>“Have a weed, Craig, and I’ll give you a
synopsis of the game for to-night’s desperate
play, which of course is to be carried out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
within the classic shades of the Midway
Plaisance.”</p>

<p>When both of them are comfortably
settled, and the cigars pronounced excellent,
Samson Cereal opens fire upon the peculiar
subject that must next demand their attention—the
plotting of the Oriental, Aroun Scutari.</p>

<p>“How the devil they learned of it—except
through that treacherous valet of mine, who
has, it seems, gone hand and glove with this
pirate, on account of some Turkish dancer he’s
fallen in love with—I’m at a loss to know;
but they seem to understand that I have an
engagement in the Midway with two gentlemen
this evening. They are bent on seeing it
by electric light. What their object is I
really don’t know, but I suspect they mean to
reproduce something of the sort, it has proved
so popular—perhaps on the stages of the
East; it may be within the grounds of the
Mid-winter Exposition at San Francisco.
That’s not my business. They are both
friends, and I’m under obligations to them.</p>

<p>“Since they request me to accompany
them, I have agreed. Besides, I never tire of
seeing the Congress of Nations, though, truth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
to tell, as you yourself know, my boy, I have
no reason to look upon anything Turkish with
love.</p>

<p>“This duty takes me there, and by the exercise
of a little diplomacy I may be inveigled
into some trap, for there are many unsuspected
ones in that same Plaisance, don’t forget
it. This is only the prelude. Listen to
what follows, and for devilish ingenuity it
takes the cake:</p>

<p>“The valet—I ought to call him varlet, for
if ever a treacherous dog lived, it is this same
Anthony Wayne whom I have loaded with
favors—this valet now plays his miserable
part in the drama.</p>

<p>“He is a penman—he can imitate my fist to
perfection, and I have more than once in a
joke plainly told him this faculty and gift
would get him into trouble yet. He will write
a note in my hand, and himself be the bearer
to Dorothy.”</p>

<p>“The deuce! does that miserable Turk still
hope to run away with her? I see very
plainly I—that is, your pardon, sir, someone—will
have to wring his neck for him yet,”
bursts out Aleck with much animation, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
not a little confusion at seeing the smile on
Samson’s face.</p>

<p>“Glad to relegate that task to you, Craig,
if the proper occasion arises. Now with regard
to this note—what will it contain, you
ask? Some startling intelligence for Dorothy—nothing
more nor less than the fact that I
have been injured in a personal encounter with
my old enemy Scutari, who is used up worse
than myself, and that I am being taken care
of by—who do you think?”</p>

<p>“Marda, the fortune teller of Cairo Street—once
your wife and her mother! Would they
use such a lever as that to open her heart and
blind her eyes?” says Craig, frowning.</p>

<p>“Bah! you don’t know these Turks. They
are utterly devoid of the tender feelings we
cherish. They buy their wives, and I tell you
the average Turkish woman is almost as much
to be pitied as some of the women of India,
who, once married, retire to their husband’s
house to look no more on a man’s face other
than his, and at his death consider themselves
lucky not to be buried with him. Ah, Craig!
our girls, bless them, never realize what
privileges they enjoy until they visit Turkey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
India, and China, where women are marketable
articles. But to return to this remarkable
tale from Aladdin or some of the Arabian
Nights’ entertainments.</p>

<p>“The letter is expected to deceive Dorothy,
and cause her to accompany Anthony Wayne,
who has long been with me, and shares my
confidence. Her first thought would be to
take her maid, but Anthony will see to it that
she is indisposed—he can easily drug the poor
girl in some way. It is the purpose of the
scoundrels to bring Dorothy to the Midway,
for half of the Turk’s pleasure would be lost if
I met my fate ignorant of his full purpose.”</p>

<p>“Good Heavens, Mr. Cereal! you speak so
calmly about it, I am amazed. Do you really
mean that it is his intention to—injure you
bodily—to make away with you?”</p>

<p>“I have reason to believe so, though ready
to confess the Turk is a puzzle to me.
Beyond a certain point this description of
their plan does not go. Enough is known for
me to block their little game in the start, if I
so desire, by calling upon the police and having
them arrested.”</p>

<p>“You will do so, of course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>Samson Cereal gives a dry chuckle.</p>

<p>“That would be the allopathic way—putting
an obstacle in front of the runaway horse,
Fever, and checking him with a smash. I’m
a homeopath, and my principle is to start
another horse after him, gradually overtake
the flying rascal, and bring him to terms.
Thence, I shall meet cunning with cunning—<i>similia
similibus curantur</i>.”</p>

<p>“But—my dear sir, will you allow
Dorothy—I beg pardon, Miss Cereal—to
undergo these terrible chances?”</p>

<p>Aleck is worried—he is a Canadian, and
hardly understands what a reckless American
speculator like Samson Cereal might be
tempted to do, once a wild freak seized upon
him.</p>

<p>“No occasion for worry, my dear Craig.
We’ll arrange it so that you and your friend
may be on hand at the climax. Oh! I’ve got
a part for each of you to play, never fear.
The curtain rises on the grand <i>finale</i> when
our trustworthy Anthony enters with the lady
he has brought from here in a carriage——”</p>

<p>“Then you do—oh, Mr. Cereal, think——”</p>

<p>“The lady,” continues the operator calmly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
flipping the ashes from his cigar with his little
finger, and not noticing Aleck’s excited interruption,
“who is veiled, who appears terribly
uneasy, and sobs now and then, yet who has
not spoken a word on the long journey to the
Midway. In short, Mr. Craig, it is my intention
to personate my daughter with one of the
keenest detectives in Chicago, who can play
his part to a dot, up to the climax.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Cereal, I beg pardon. I had not
grasped your idea. Now I can commend it as
splendid, sir,” says Craig heartily.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="chaptitle">AGAIN UNDER THE WITCHERY OF CAIRO STREET.</p>


<p>Another summer day is drawing to a close,
and lights are springing up along the merry
Midway as if by magic. If a strange, eerie
place during the day, with its curious inhabitants
and remarkable specimens of world-wide
architecture from humble South Sea Island
huts to Turkish mosques, Persian palaces,
and Chinese pagodas, the effect is greatly
lightened when these wonders are viewed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
the aid of thousands upon thousands of
lamps, colored lanterns, and electric lights.</p>

<p>After the numerous villages and streets,
bazaars and countless shops had once got into
full working order, each day and night was
pretty much like another along the Midway.
Only a downfall of rain made a perceptible
difference in the crowds that haunted its
classic shades. The same weird noises came
from every hand, and a succession of sights
that made one doubt very much whether he
was in the ancient city on the Nile or the modern
Babylon, Chicago.</p>

<p>When Aleck Craig and his friend Wycherley
turn under the Intra-Mural railway and enter
upon the Plaisance, it is just evening, and
their thoughts naturally go toward supper.
They might have had a much finer meal at any
of the restaurants in the open grounds of the
Fair, but as in the case of many others, they
experience a certain amount of pleasure in
dining where they can look upon the shifting
panorama of sight-seers and fez-covered
Orientals forever drifting past.</p>

<p>All is merriment in the Midway. It is to
the great Fair what the variety stage may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
in connection with theatricals in general.
People go to tragedy to be instructed—to
learn of human passions. They look at comedy
to see life as it occurs—to weep with misery,
to rejoice over the triumph of virtue; but
when, wearied with business cares, and anxious
to forget trouble for the time being, they
desire to laugh, it is farce to which they
turn. That is why the variety theater has
gained such a hold upon the masses.</p>

<p>Intense devotion to business demands a
relaxation that shall be complete.</p>

<p>So with the famous Midway.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands viewed the glories of the
Fair with interest and awe. Its magnitude
appalled them. They could not remember
one thousandth part of what they saw. A
sense of heaviness came upon mind and body.
This was too much like work, and they had
come here for a holiday.</p>

<p>Hence, about two or three in the afternoon,
they could be seen entering the wonderful
Street of Nations in squads, most of them to
remain until nine or ten in the evening.</p>

<p>Here they found relief; here light and
gayety and good cheer abounded. Very, very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
many who haunted these grounds, over which
an indescribable charm forever rested, were
people of good taste and education. They
found here the balm in Gilead, the peace of
mind that was denied them in the whirl of
Machinery Hall or the endless displays in the
Liberal Arts. And so from one cause or
another the Midway always carried its great
crowd every afternoon and evening; the fakirs
rattled the dry bones and shouted themselves
hoarse in endeavoring to draw the shekels out
of pockets that were only too willing; the
bazaars glittered with their tinsel and chaff;
and over the whole scene was spread a
glamour the like of which was never before
known on American soil; all the ancient
countries of the world bringing their gew gaws
and costumes and ways of living, to spread
them out to the gaze of the youngest nation
on earth, the giant of the West.</p>

<p>The Canadian and his friend seat themselves
at a table where they can see this shifting
panorama, and order supper. Near by rises
the great Ferris wheel, now ablaze with electric
fires, and revolving on its axis with steady
“clank, clank, clank, clank.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span></p>

<p>Looking up at its tremendous dimensions,
Aleck finds it hard to believe what strange
things have occurred to him since he took his
memorable ride two nights previous. It all
passes in review before his mental vision like
a dream, and yet he has much cause for feeling
cheerful. At that time he was searching
for somebody, with a hope that daily grew less—now
he has found the object of his pursuit,
and uncertainty has given way to definite hope.</p>

<p>Wycherley is as merry as ever. His fortunes
have taken a sudden turn since the time
he and Aleck met with their adventures in
this same Midway, and one would hardly
recognize the man in his neat business suit.
It is doubtful whether Claude is lighter of
heart than before. Now cares have come to
bring lines upon his face, responsibility will
be apt to sober him down a little. With some
men, light of pocket means light of heart; fill
their purse and you bring corroding care, anxiety,
fear of robbery, and the kindred evils
which in their needy state they never knew.</p>

<p>“You’ve arranged business with Mr. Cereal,
I believe you said, Wycherley,” remarks
Aleck, as, having finished their light repast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
they buy the waiter body and soul with a fee,
and then proceed to enjoy a cigar while watching
the endless procession stroll by.</p>

<p>“Yes, he has taken me under his wing,
and I’m quite content to let him mold me into
whatever he likes. Presume he sees something
in a fellow of my build that can be
made available. Of course nothing is settled
yet, and probably won’t be until we wind up
Mr. Turk from the Bosphorus and his rascally
game, but I expect to be the Co. of the Samson
Cereal concern some day in the near
future.”</p>

<p>He does not say this boastingly, but with a
quiet assurance that goes to the point. Already
the ex-actor is changing.</p>

<p>“Speaking of that same Turk, there he
goes.”</p>

<p>“By my life, you speak truly, milord. He
has not seen us, I trow. It might be well to
hang our heads so that, if he looks this way,
he will fail to believe we are anything more
than the ordinary footpads who haunt this
classic ground, demanding the coin of the
realm to fill their bulging Turkish pockets.”</p>

<p>His meaning is clear enough, though to one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
who did not know his ways, the words might
seem ambiguous. They continue to watch
Aroun Scutari, though careful not to show
their faces.</p>

<p>The Turk is heading for the large bazaar
near by, but comes to a halt just at the corner
of the Persian Palace. As he stands there
another man joins him, and the two converse
with much animation, judging from their gestures.</p>

<p>“Why not follow them; it will bring us to
the trap quicker than in any other way?”</p>

<p>Wycherley it is who suggests the idea, and
his companion falls in with it at once. They
are anxious to be on the move at any rate.
Some around them, looking weary and haggard,
are only too glad of a chance to rest.</p>

<p>In a crowd like that which haunts the spectacular
Midway, it is not as difficult to follow a
person undetected as might be believed. All
that is necessary is to keep him in view, never
losing him for a second, and making sure to
have a squad just in front, behind which one
is safe from observation in case the pursued
is suspicious and casts many glances over his
shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>In this way they follow the Turk to Cairo
Street. He enters, and Aleck turns to his
companion.</p>

<p>“We had better follow,” he says, knowing
that the final act in the drama is to be worked
out in the shadow of these buildings that so
nearly represent a street from the banks of
the Nile.</p>

<p>“Good, I’m with you,” returns Wycherley,
as he actually buys two tickets and hands
them to the Arab boy at the door, who stares
at him, and even runs after him, making signs,
which the reformed actor calmly ignores.</p>

<p>Aleck is laughing in a quiet way—the scene
is really ridiculous—the supreme indifference
of the lordly Wycherley—the belief of the
Arab youth that he has discovered an old
enemy, with whom he has had many encounters,
only to be worsted time and again, and his
wonder at the passive submission of the man
who heretofore made it a point never to pay.</p>

<p>“What amuses you, comrade?” demands
the ex-actor soberly.</p>

<p>“The leopard has changed his spots. Only
two nights ago you bulldozed that same youth
into letting us in free. He is amazed—bewildered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
at your allowing yourself to be
mulcted now.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that was Wycherley the vagabond,
sailing on the strength of past affiliation with
tramps and nomads of all kinds. Presto!
behold Wycherley the broker, the partner
of a millionaire. Is it possible that you don’t
see that I must <i>reform</i>? When I clothed myself
in that dress suit last night, I put off the
old life, as if it had never been. That is my
privilege. Don’t believe, my dear fellow, that
I can ever be anything but a merry dog; but
there’s a way of drawing the line, and I’ve
chalked it out. The dead line at Andersonville
was of small moment compared with it.
Over that line I never step again, so long as
fortune smiles.”</p>

<p>“On the whole a very sensible way of
arranging it. Does you credit, my boy. Now
our man the enemy is pushing down the
street. Shall we follow? is the question, or
hold aloof with the crowd here that jeers at
the camel riders and mocks those who bestride
the long-eared donkeys. Everybody laughs;
it’s in the air. Let’s stop and see the fun,
meanwhile keeping an eye beyond the mosque<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
for signs of the spider’s web across Cairo
Street,” replies Aleck.</p>

<p>“When does Samson Cereal expect to bring
up in this den of lions?”</p>

<p>“Between eight and half-past.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ve got a little time. I suggest
a rise in the world. Look at that balcony
above. We can gain it by a little silver. No
one is there. It will give us a view of the
whole scene. We may pull our hats down
and keep an eye on everything that occurs.”</p>

<p>“A good scheme. This crowd is too jovial
by half. Look at the donkey boys plunging
their little jacks directly through it, and you
hear only feminine shrieks or the hoarse
laughter of men; not an angry word. I’ve
never before seen an American crowd put
up with so much abuse and humbug. It’s
miraculous.” And Aleck is right; many
marvel at the sight, and can only believe there
must be some witchery in the air.</p>

<p>From the odd balcony of the house in Cairo
Street the view is entrancing, and once seen
can never be forgotten. Our friends do not
forget the business that brings them to the
place, and while smiling at the ludicrous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
sights presented below, with amateur camel
riders hugging each other upon the swaying
ships of the desert, and letting out volleys of
shrieks that are music to Arab ears, they keep
continually on the watch for those who are
to start the serious part of the drama into
action.</p>

<p>Suddenly Wycherley utters an exclamation.</p>

<p>“What do you see?” asks his companion,
in doubt as to whether the other has made
a pleasing discovery or the opposite, for he
remembers the Spanish cigar girl and Wycherley
has not yet renounced his claims in that
quarter, though only the night before paying
gallant attention to a banker’s daughter.</p>

<p>“Observe yonder camel and his riders,”
replies Claude.</p>

</div>

<p class="chaptitle">THE OLD GAME OF THE SPIDER AND THE FLY.</p>


<p>“Jove! there he is, sure enough, and riding
a camel too. What is come over Samson
Cereal, the sedate king of the wheat pit? I am
amazed!” declares the Canadian.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, you should be surprised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
at nothing here. I tell you it’s in the air.
Haven’t I seen one of the most learned professors
of Yale perched on the hump of a
camel, grinning from ear to ear; while his
companion, a preacher whose name is a household
word from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
whose sermons are weekly printed wherever
the English language is spoken, trotted up and
down this street on a diminutive donkey,
his feet scraping the ground. I’d have given
something for a snap-shot camera at that time.
Look at our friend—he’s enjoying the lark as
much as would a schoolboy.”</p>

<p>“Very true, and under ordinary circumstances
I can see how this might be; but to-night
he is to face a crisis in his affairs, and carry out
his own scheme for defeating Aroun Scutari.”</p>

<p>“Just so, Aleck, and give him credit for
appearing quite natural. His friends are here
to take in the Street, and as a Chicagoan
Samson has to join them in the frolic. Here
they come up the aisle again. Did you ever
see such a sight as when the camel runs, jolting
them out of breath. It’s an hilarious old
time the boys have in this place. Everybody
grows young again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>“Let us descend. The time for action
draws near.”</p>

<p>“How about weapons?” asks Wycherley.</p>

<p>“I have none save what nature gave me,
and in times past have been taught to depend
upon them in emergencies. I reckon I shall
be able to render a good account of myself
when the crisis comes. How about you,
Claude?”</p>

<p>“I’m a Western man, you know, and in my
peregrinations I’ve learned to know the value
of a cold deck. Trust a tramp for that. Besides,
I’ve been in Texas in my time. They’ve
got odd ideas down there. You can’t trust to
appearances. I saw a man arrested once, the
most innocent looking party imaginable, as
meek as Moses, and at sight I’d swear he was
an itinerant circuit rider, a 'saddlebags,’ as
we call ’em; yet when they came to search him
they found seven packs of cards on his person,
and enough revolvers and bowie knives to
fit out a whole regiment of Rangers. So you
see when a fellow’s spent some time among such
scenes, he naturally imbibes the same ideas.”</p>

<p>“But I never knew you to go armed before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>“My dear man, that was because I had
nothing to lose; in all probability my curiosities
were in hock. Now that I’m a respectable
member of society again, with silver jingling
in my pocket, I stand a chance of being
robbed. Someone may envy me this fine suit
of clothes. One of my first acts was to redeem
an old pet of mine—and here you
are.”</p>

<p>With that he unbuttons his loose sack coat.
As he throws it open Aleck stares. A belt
encircles Wycherley’s waist, and fastened in
this is a revolver. Aleck is not a man of war,
but at the same time something of a sportsman,
and familiar with firearms.</p>

<p>“Let me see it, Claude—a little old-fashioned,
but a good weapon. You treasure it—why?”</p>

<p>“It was given to me once upon a time by a
man I valued as a friend. I was hardly more
than a boy at the time. That weapon has
sounded the deathknell of many a man.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! not in your hands, I hope?”</p>

<p>At this Claude laughs.</p>

<p>“No, indeed. I’ve never fired it in all
these years. You have heard of an eccentric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
genius known by the name of Wild Bill—it
belonged to him. I was enabled to do him a
favor, and he insisted on giving me this. A
month later he passed in his checks, poor
fellow.”</p>

<p>“You mean he was killed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the man who shot Hickok was
too much of a coward to face him, but entered
the room where he played cards, and shot
Wild Bill in the back. He paid the piper,
though.”</p>

<p>“Judge Lynch held court?”</p>

<p>“Well, he got away at first, but the boys
just up and howled. There was a trial, and
in the end the matter was settled.”</p>

<p>“By the way, is it loaded?”</p>

<p>“I reckon not, but that don’t count. I
depend on the general appearance of things to
intimidate. If that fails me, here is another
Texan trick.”</p>

<p>How he does it the Canadian never knows,
but this wonderful genius, once actor, tramp,
cowboy, and now stockbroker, puts his hand
up to the back of his neck and draws out a most
formidable weapon—half knife, half sword—a
curiosity that would charm a collector,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
rusty in spots, even nicked and shabby, yet
showing signs of former splendor as a Texan
bowie.</p>

<p>“You see I had my choice of this and a
Mexican <i>machete</i> I own among my curios, and
I took this because it lies so charmingly along
one’s back under the coat—its shape was
adapted to that very purpose by Colonel
Bowie, who invented it, and I assure you,
Aleck, I have positive proof that this is the
identical weapon he fashioned himself and
used to such advantage.”</p>

<p>Craig throws up his hands.</p>

<p>“I no longer doubt the outcome. If those
poor Turks ever set their eyes on that saber,
their wretched knees will knock together like
Spanish castanets and the Street of Cairo
which once was haunted with their presence
will know them never again.”</p>

<p>“Craig, you are heartless—cruel. Sir, in
the land of the Texan this is reckoned only as
a play toy.”</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake put it away. The
sight of it is enough to bring up thoughts of
<i>hari kari</i>. If one hated himself he could not
wish for anything more desperate with which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
to end his existence than that same old rusty
blade,” says Aleck.</p>

<p>“Rusty old blade, forsooth! You have no
reverence for relics, Craig. In the hands of
one entirely great, the bowie is mightier than
the sword.”</p>

<p>“Well, come along, my boy. <i>Tempus
fugit</i>, and I see Samson Cereal with his
friends sauntering down the avenue. When
he separates from them, as will soon be the
case, the Turkish spider will throw his wonderful
web across the street, and the American
fly be asked to 'walk into my little
parlor!’”</p>

<p>Wycherley buttons up his coat and carefully
conceals his array of weapons. No one
looking at him now would dream he was such
a walking arsenal. Appearances are deceptive,
and many a person who goes about this
Midway Plaisance wears a mask.</p>

<p>Thus they leave their eyrie, and once more
rub elbows with the jostling, good-natured
crowd, that surges about the spot where the
camels kneel to receive and deposit their
squealing burdens.</p>

<p>Sauntering down Cairo Street, they keep at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
a respectable distance behind the great operator
and his two companions.</p>

<p>The time for action is near at hand. No
doubt the Turk fumes at seeing how Samson’s
friends stick closer than brothers, and doubtless
he is exercising his mind in the endeavor
to invent some way of separating them.</p>

<p>He need not worry. Samson himself will
arrange all that. The two gentlemen appear
to be ordinary business men, one stout
and red-faced, the other tall and cadaverous.
They survey the scene as though indelibly
stamping it on their minds for production,
and are interested in all the details.</p>

<p>Finally they drew near the bend. Here on
the left Cairo Street, more narrow than before,
runs down to the stables of the donkeys and
camels, beyond which rise the needles of
Cleopatra, guarding the entrance of the
Egyptian Temple of Luxor. On the right the
main street continues a short distance, terminating
in the theater where the dancing
girls amaze and disgust most of those who
go in to see their gyrations.</p>

<p>At the point of division is the well remembered
“cold drink” café, where Turkish and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
Egyptian flavors are given to weak American
lemonade, or ice cream of a like character
served in a glass. It is second habit for the
pilgrims of Cairo Street to try every novelty,
and so they purchase a <i>horchata</i> as the people
of Spain call these refrescos—expressed juice of
the fruit, mingled with sugar and cold water.</p>

<p>While they discuss the merits of the beverage
the three friends talk of their plans, and
presently the two who have come to take in
all the sights, on business principles, leave
Samson Cereal standing there, while they
enter the door of the theater, through which
the Turkish bridegroom runs, carrying his
bride, at the termination of the ridiculous
“bridal procession,” given several times each
afternoon and evening, with all the pomp of
gayly caparisoned camels, mounted swordsmen,
flashy palanquin and the most excruciating
music that ever assailed American ears.</p>

<p>“At last—alone!” says Wycherley, and
Aleck is compelled to smile at the reference,
for only an hour or so previous, both of them
have been admiring the picture of the young
husband folding his bride in his arms after
the wedding guests have gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>Now is the time for the Turk to start his
little game of Oriental duplicity. Having but
a faint idea of the manner in which Scutari
intends to act, Aleck is, of course, deeply interested
in the whole business. He and Wycherley
have halted at a convenient distance, and
watch for the spider to send his emissary
forth.</p>

<p>Just across the way is the room of the
veiled fortune teller, though no flaming sign
announces her presence, only the modest wording
given before. That it is through her in
some way the manipulator of wheat is to be
trapped, Aleck does not doubt, and yet he
cannot fully believe the woman is in league
with Scutari. They only met two evenings
before, and he seemed astonished at her
presence in Cairo Street. Perhaps he has not
seen her in these twenty years. Why should
she enter into a league with the Turk—she has
no reason to hate her former husband, and
least of all should the mother conspire to
throw her child into the hands of one she
loathes.</p>

<p>Of course the tricky Aroun knows how to
utilize certain forces—he has made a study of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
woman, Turkish women at least, and believes
he can bend them to his will. Through cunning,
then, he may cause Marda to be the bait
that will draw the foolish fly into the net.</p>

<p>“Look!” says Wycherley.</p>

<p>Samson is no longer alone.</p>

<p>Standing at his side is an Arab boy—such a
lad as races the donkeys up and down, and
takes a fiendish pleasure in scaring old ladies
half to death by shouting in their ear as his
long-eared charge rubs against their arm in
passing. This dark skinned youth rises on his
toes to deliver a card to the American with the
gray mustache, and then makes a low salaam,
sweeping his arms in the direction of the wall,
where over the narrow door and under the odd
latticed balcony window one can read the sign
of</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center bbox"><span class="smcap">Saidee—the Veiled Fortune Teller.</span></p>
</div>

<p>“What will he do with it?” mutters the
irrepressible Wycherley in Aleck’s ears, but
the intended joke is Greek to the Canadian,
who, while half an American at heart, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
never been educated up to the standard of
American humor.</p>

<p>“He reads it—see that start, that eager
glance around. Well done, Samson, old boy.
I’ll have you playing first walking gent in my
traveling combination before you’re many
moons older. Now his gaze is fastened on the
door. He advances like a lamb to the
slaughter, and hands in his little quarter.
Shout, ye Turkish hosts, for the game is
apparently won!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="chaptitle">DOROTHY.</p>


<p>The ex-actor has reported matters in pretty
much the way they occur. Samson plays his
part in a manner that need never shame him,
and perhaps secretly enjoys the situation.
To a man engaged in his business, where he
daily matches his wit and shrewdness against
the diplomacy of others, the constant friction
must of necessity polish these qualities.
There is no danger of rust with a wide-awake
operator on 'Change. This, then, really comes
in line with his daily business, only now he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
deals with a tricky Turk instead of howling
brokers, and the stake is not a fortune—it
may be his life.</p>

<p>It is characteristic of the man that he
insists upon managing his own game and
beating his old-time enemy in person. Most
men, under similar conditions, would gladly
turn the whole business over to the police,
and put the Turk from the Golden Horn
through a course of American law and justice
that would prevent his reappearance in his
old haunts until the holding of the next
World’s Fair in Russia.</p>

<p>Not so Samson Cereal.</p>

<p>He has depended upon himself so many
years, to reward his friends and punish his
enemies, that it never occurs to him to shirk
the responsibility.</p>

<p>Hence, in accordance with his well-arranged
plans he walks over to the narrow doorway at
exactly ten minutes of nine and enters. The
camels have been withdrawn from the scene,
and make ready to fill their places in the
delayed bridal procession which will soon
take possession of the narrow street. Now
the donkey boys have full swing, and how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
they do belabor the tough little beasts.
Really it is astonishing that the officers of the
S. P. C. A. do not interfere, unless it has been
previously proven to their satisfaction that
from the days of Balaam and his talking ass,
the stubborn little animals are insensible to
pain. Besides, this beating is all done with
so much good nature, one can hardly find an
excuse for interfering.</p>

<p>“How long do we wait?” asks Wycherley,
as he raises his hand to his neck, which significant
action causes the Canadian to laugh
softly and move away from him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m perfectly harmless, I assure you,
my dear boy. Not the least bit excited.
Icicles are nothing in comparison. But you
haven’t answered my question.”</p>

<p>“It may be five, it may be ten minutes. He
will be kept waiting in there. The prophetess
must charm him, and hold him until the noise
of the passing procession fills the whole street.
Then Scutari’s blow will fall. We will
leave here when the booming of guns below
announces that the camels are coming.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes!” and Wycherley, of course, begins
to whistle the old Scotch song that once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
upon a time, to a band of desperate Britons
caged in beleaguered Lucknow in India, was
heard when hope had almost left them, and,
wafted over the hills, came to their ears as the
sweetest sound on God’s earth.</p>

<p>“No one else enters—see, a couple have just
been turned away,” Aleck remarks.</p>

<p>“Yet there goes a red fez in. Turks are
welcome—standing room only, greatest success
of the Midway. I’m all of a quiver to see the
grand entrance of Anthony Wayne, the valet,
and the detective who is to represent Miss
Dorothy. Great head, that of my respected
partner. He believes in fighting fire with fire.
Was that the drum signal?”</p>

<p>“No; they’re not ready yet—plenty of time.
Be patient, comrade.”</p>

<p>“Jove! there’s my lovely senorita.”</p>

<p>“What, the Spanish cigar girl?”</p>

<p>“Sauntering along with a dandy dude, and
casting coquettish looks up into his stupid
face.”</p>

<p>“You don’t appear excited at all. How is
this?” pretending to feel his pulse.</p>

<p>“That was Vagabond Claude. The gentleman
Wycherley casts his eyes higher.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>“H’m! a banker’s daughter. That’s the
way the wind blows, is it?”</p>

<p>“I protest—I’ve admitted nothing, only
that an unfathomable gulf lies between the
old life and the new.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Craig!”</p>

<p>“Good Heavens! who spoke?” exclaims
Aleck, suddenly grasping his friend’s arm.</p>

<p>He looks around. There are people pushing
this way and that—sight-seers, pilgrims,
foreigners, and all the varieties of the <i>genus
homo</i> daily seen upon this gay passage—this
cleft of folly. None of them gives any token
of being the speaker. Besides the voice was
that of a woman, and its tones thrilled Aleck
through and through.</p>

<p>“Who called my name?” he asks again
in bewilderment, as his companion has failed
to make a reply.</p>

<p>“I pass, Aleck. Give me something easy,”
returns that mystified individual.</p>

<p>“But you heard it?”</p>

<p>“Correct.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you know the voice?”</p>

<p>“Jove! now, I wouldn’t swear to it, but,
somehow, it put me in mind of—Dorothy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>“Just as I thought. She is here. In spite
of her father’s precautions they have inveigled
her to the spider’s web.” And filled with a
new spirit of alarm, the young Canadian again
begins to glance at each person near by, as
though he suspects the speculator’s lovely
daughter would come here in the disguise of
an old woman with bonnet and blue glasses,
or a dashing sport swinging a delicate cane
and wearing eye-glasses.</p>

<p>In the midst of his dilemma he again hears
his name called:</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Craig! look this way. I am in
this little shop. I wish to speak to you. At
first I dared not, but I saw my father enter
there and as my necessity grew greater my
courage arose. I need a friend’s advice. Will
you give it to me?”</p>

<p>Before half of this speech is finished Aleck has
fastened his eyes upon the speaker. The little
shop is dim, and he can only see that it is a
female form, for a heavy veil conceals the face.</p>

<p>Instantly Craig remembers what was said by
Happy Jack concerning the hatred of Aroun
Scutari for him, on account of the interference
with his plans, in connection with the strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
Ferris wheel game, and that should the opportunity
offer he has a rod in pickle for the
Canadian.</p>

<p>He has read of the ancient Circe, the stories
of mythical mermaids who sang so sweetly to
mariners of old, and, strange as it may appear,
these things flash into his mind now.</p>

<p>Can it be a trap? Have his enemies arranged
a nice little web to entangle the Canadian
fly?</p>

<p>That voice—no other could thrill him as it
has done. He hesitates only a few seconds,
and she has hardly finished speaking when his
mind is quite made up.</p>

<p>To enter the booth it is necessary to drop
down and under the counter at one corner.
Wycherley makes no effort to follow him, but
stands guard just outside, watching the couple
for fear lest some evil befall his companion,
and casting an occasional glance across the
way at the sign of the fortune teller, while he
listens for the beginning of the infernal racket
that will announce the wedding procession’s
start from the lower end of Cairo Street.</p>

<p>When Aleck has entered the booth, he pays
no attention to the girl who has charge of it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
and who has befriended Dorothy. All his
doubt is removed, for the latter has raised her
veil. He is amazed to see her here, after
being assured by Samson Cereal that she
would not be notified of the plot.</p>

<p>Her agitation shows that she knows something
of the danger. Time presses, and Aleck
awakens to the fact that whatever he does
must be done with speed.</p>

<p>“Miss Dorothy, how come you to be here?”
he asks, pressing the hand held out to him.</p>

<p>“It is too long a story to tell in detail. I
heard something last night, when that wild
young man, Mr. Phœnix, was present, that
not only aroused my curiosity but my anxiety.
It came back to me again and again,
how my father bade him be silent about the
woman in Cairo Street whom he had long believed
dead. I could see from his actions that
there was a mystery behind it all. This evening
when I sat alone after supper I received a
note. I don’t know how it came to the house,
but someone put it in my hands.</p>

<p>“This note—I can recall every word of it—was
written in a hand evidently unused to our
language, but I made it out. It ran like this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I beg of you, sweet Dorothy, to come with your
maid, or your half-brother, to the Street in Cairo to-night
at nine. I can no longer remain silent. If I die
for it I must see you, talk with you. Ask for Saidee,
the fortune teller. Your heart will tell you who it is
signs herself.</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">One You Have Long Believed Dead.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Craig! I could guess—my heart
indeed told me that this was my mother.
From my father I have never heard the story
of the past, but it would be strange if, living
to almost twenty, I were unable to discover
something of the truth. I have never known
a mother’s love, and though she may have
sinned like the other one, yet she is my
mother. I would see her, <i>must</i> see her. I
knew not what to do at first. John was out,
my maid sick. I am not easily balked in anything
of this nature. There is too much of
Samson Cereal’s blood in my veins for that.
We have a faithful coachman. I sent for Pat,
and, as well as I could, explained that I
wanted his company. He would lay down his
life for me, and although dreading my father’s
wrath, he consented to come.</p>

<p>“So we started. The elevated brought us
here, and Pat stands just a dozen feet yonder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
ready to do anything I tell him, from fight to
running away. My heart failed me as the
time drew near. I sought shelter here and
waited in trembling suspense. Imagine my
surprise when I saw my father entering yonder
place. While I debated upon my course,
and became more and more excited as the
minutes flew by, I was suddenly relieved,
for you came and stood near by. On
several other occasions, Mr. Craig, you have
been able to assist me in times of great distress.
Forgive me if I am importunate, but I
must see this woman who calls out for me.
John has found his mother, and strange
though it may seem to you, I would look
upon the face of the one who once loved me
as a babe.</p>

<p>“You can help me, will help me, I feel
sure, for I am determined to solve this
mystery, come what may.”</p>

<p>She waits for an answer.</p>

<p>Aleck fears that Mr. Cereal may take him
to task for it, but he cannot prevent her from
going, at any rate, and in his company she will
be safer. Besides, once in the presence of
those eyes, now tear-dimmed, he is powerless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
to refuse her anything. There never was a
more helpless captive.</p>

<p>“Miss Dorothy, your wishes are law to me.
I had hoped you would be safe at home while
this singular climax of the drama was taking
place in Cairo Street, but since you are here, I
cannot refuse your request.”</p>

<p>“I thank you from my heart, sir. It is this
craving to look upon her face, to hear her
speak, to call her that dear name—for she is
my mother no matter how guilty or how sadly
wronged—that has made me dare all. When
shall we enter? It is surely nine o’clock.”</p>

<p>Her manner is eager; she trembles not with
fear, but with the excitement of anticipation.</p>

<p>“We will go now,” replies Aleck, for the
boom of drums announces the coming of the
weird wedding procession.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE PASHA CLAPS HIS HANDS.</p>


<p>Wycherley has not been able to hear the
conversation inside the booth, but he catches
the martial music from the streets, and is just
about to inform the Canadian that they must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
delay no longer when he sees Aleck coming
out.</p>

<p>“It is Miss Dorothy, Claude, and she
knows who is in yonder building. She desires
to see the fortune teller. It would be useless
to argue the matter. We must take her with
us. Surely, in company with such a walking
arsenal as yourself, she need not fear.”</p>

<p>What can Wycherley say? He has been
completely disarmed after hearing this compliment
to his prowess.</p>

<p>“Then let us be going, my dear boy. Miss
Cereal, have no fears. This is not exactly
according to contract, but we must accept the
situation as we find it. Hark! the wedding
march; Lohengrin not in it. Straight across
the street to the door. See how that stout herald
swings his sword—what fierceness—what
scowls—now a benign smile comes over his
face. Bah! it is all mere show, like so many
of their exhibitions. I turn my back on it.
Here we are. What! the door closed in our
faces; not if Claude Wycherley knows it.”</p>

<p>The boy at the door does indeed attempt to
shut it, but a foot thrust forward prevents
him, and before he can gather his wits to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
an alarm, Wycherley has flung wide the door
and seized him.</p>

<p>For half a minute he indulges in some of his
former pyrotechnics, a combination of quick
gestures and scowls, and the Turkish lad, as if
in mortal fear, tries to slink away; but as the
others have already entered, Claude gives the
boy a sudden whirl that lands him, a dazed
heap, outside the door, which is immediately
closed upon him.</p>

<p>Thus they can call their first assault upon
the enemy’s castle a victory. If it is a sample
of what awaits them just beyond, they can
congratulate themselves.</p>

<p>They are under the roof of the fortune
teller. The space beyond the door forms a
small hallway. Further on, through a winding
passage they will find Saidee’s reception chamber,
where the veiled seeress from the Orient
has received those who seek her occult aid, and
reads the future from the lines of their hands.</p>

<p>Aleck has a grave sensation steal over him.
It is as though someone he loves is about to
meet peril. It may be Dorothy! What cruel
fate has brought her here at this dread
hour when the vengeance that has slumbered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
these twenty years is about to break forth;
when the Turk who was outwitted on his
own ground by Samson Cereal now figures on
making the score even?</p>

<p>Craig fears the worst, and in his desire to
stand between Dorothy and harm, he draws
her hand through his left arm, while his right
fist is clenched. Woe betide the luckless
Turk who feels the weight of the young
athlete’s hand on this particular night, for he
is aroused to send a blow that would do John
L. Sullivan credit!</p>

<p>And Wycherley?</p>

<p>That strange rover has seen many queer
things in his life, and, heavily armed with the
weapons he carries, might be looked upon as
a dangerous customer. After ejecting the
youth in such an unceremonious manner,
and closing the door, to which there is no bolt
or lock, his next act is to unfasten his coat, so
that the terrible weapon in his belt may be disclosed,
and strike fear to the enemy’s heart.
Then he raises his hand to his neck.</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, don’t draw that terrible
blade yet,” whispers Aleck, watching
the motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span></p>

<p>“The appeal is carried, but it’s only a question
of time,” answers the other, <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>“Come, we must advance. Lead the way,
my dear fellow,” announces Craig, for the
thunder of Turkish music in the narrow street
deadens the sound of voices so thoroughly
that they need have little fear of being overheard.</p>

<p>Thus they move along the erratic passage.
Wycherley serves as the picket line, stealing
on tiptoe, his whole demeanor that of a person
upon whom the success or failure of the
play depends.</p>

<p>Beyond them hang heavy curtains. Here
they will find the room of the fortune teller.
Having passed these portals on a former occasion,
both Claude and the Canadian know what
to expect, so they have no hesitation about
drawing them aside and looking beyond.</p>

<p>Instead of doing this in the middle, Wycherley
goes to one side while Aleck draws his
lovely companion to the other.</p>

<p>“Courage,” he whispers in her ear, for as
the sound of voices reaches their ears, coming
from the interior, she begins to tremble.</p>

<p>It so happens, whether intentionally or not,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
that in thus finding a means of gazing beyond
the passage, both the men clutch the heavy
draperies and in a measure conceal their forms
from the view of anyone who might come after.
They do not forget they are in the house of
enemies—that a dark plot has been formed
against Dorothy’s father, and until the old
speculator has a chance of showing his hand,
they would do well to remain unseen.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, a wise plan.</p>

<p>When Aleck takes a peep into the apartment
beyond, he sees a stirring spectacle, and
yet it does not differ a particle from what he
expected.</p>

<p>The first figure his eyes light upon is that
of Samson Cereal. Standing there the man
has assumed a dramatic pose that must fill
Wycherley’s heart with delight as he thinks
of him as his “first walking old gentleman.”</p>

<p>Not five feet away stands Saidee.</p>

<p>The indications of her former beauty are
still apparent upon her face, upon every line
of it intense emotion is expressed. Tears
course down her cheeks, her long hair sweeps
over her shoulders, both hands are stretched
out beseechingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>

<p>That is the picture Aleck sees, and he can
feel his companion quiver with suppressed
excitement as she, too, gazes upon it, and, for
the first time since her babyhood, sees the
face of her mother.</p>

<p>He fears lest she may faint, nor thinks it
strange under the peculiar circumstances that
he should slip an arm around her waist. She
does not resent it—at such a time the strong
arm of an honest man is not to be despised.</p>

<p>Saidee is pleading her cause. She is not in
the plot of the cunning pasha, and believes
Samson Cereal has come here to upbraid her because
her heart yearned for her child. She
speaks good English, though in her eagerness
and emotion she sometimes trips in her speech
as though the words were too weak to express
her meaning. This is what they hear,
and the words sink deeply into one heart at
least:</p>

<p>“You have had her love all these years;
can you deny me one look, one kiss, and my
heart so hungry for it? Ah! Samson Cereal,
you believe me bad, but it is not so. I was
only crazy to again see my home; I believed I
should die in this cold Chicago. Then I laid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
a plan. My brother came, you knew it not.
We meant to take my little one and fly to our
home, but at the last a move of yours ruined my
hopes, and I had to leave my Dorothy behind.</p>

<p>“Alas! those years. I wrote to you, but
my letters came back unopened. Then I went
to England, where my brother had charge of
a great work. I labored with him for years.
We are known and honored in London. All
this while I hungered to see my child, yet
dared not come. At last the Fair—I conceived
a plan, and behold you see me! Twice have
I looked upon her, but she did not know it.
Ah! so fair, so sweet; it almost drove me
wild to think I could not take her in my arms
and say, 'I am thy mother.’</p>

<p>“Unable to longer endure it, I wrote her a
note. Perhaps I did wrong: the God to whom
you taught me to pray shall judge. Instead
of my child, the stern father comes to judge,
to condemn.</p>

<p>“Well, what can I say? My only fault was
that, homesick and weak, I left you in this
cold city and fled with my brother. When I
repented and would have returned—on my
knees begging your forgiveness—you scorned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
me, never even reading my plea. We women
of Georgia are proud; it is our nature. I
could not seek you again. Now you know all.
Once you loved me—is that feeling utterly
dead in your heart? If I could bring you
overwhelming proof that I have ever been true
as the needle to the pole, that my only fault
was in giving way to this terrible home sickness,
would you, oh, Samson Cereal, hate me,
scorn me still?”</p>

<p>He lets his head fall on his breast and
groans; surely such a scene as this was not
in the contract when he planned to meet and
defeat Aroun Scutari. He has expected that
this woman is in sympathy with the Turk,
that she will gloat over his capture, and laugh
in derision while he fumes. Instead, she
appeals to his heart, batters down the walls of
his prejudice, and awakens feelings that have
lain dormant, frozen, almost a score of years.</p>

<p>“I do not ask,” she goes on, choking back
her sobs, “to be your wife again—that I know
is impossible; but, in the name of mercy, allow
me only once to hear her lips call me 'mother,’
and then welcome death. This is my prayer.
See, I am at your feet—I beseech, entreat you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
not to say me nay. By all the love you once
bore me, by the affection you felt toward your
own angel mother, grant me this!”</p>

<p>He may be made of ice, this man. Her wild
entreaty thaws him out.</p>

<p>“It shall be as you say, woman.”</p>

<p>“God be praised!”</p>

<p>“When your brother comes, I will investigate
this claim you make. If you can prove
its truth—well, I can say nothing more, only
that, never having been divorced, you are still
my wife in the eye of the law.”</p>

<p>“It is very, very sad!” interrupts a voice,
and turning, they behold the spider who has
spun his web across Cairo Street—the sneering
Turk who has never forgotten what happened
twenty years ago.</p>

<p>The woman shudders and trembles, but not
so Samson Cereal, who stands there like the
rock that has breasted many a storm in the
panic days on 'Change.</p>

<p>The wily Turk shrugs his shoulders and
rubs his brown hands together, just as might
an ideal miser contemplating his store of gold.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is too very sad. It makes me
think of ze play I gaze upon one night in She-cago.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
All ze years two loving hearts are wide
apart. I myself bring them together, I am ze
magician who plan ze meeting. For what?
In order zat zay may continue to love as before,
and build a bridge across ze dark chasm
over which to walk again into life—into love?
Bah! not much. By ze beard of ze Prophet, I
am Aroun Scutari, a pasha—my hate lives forever!
I do not forget that she belonged to me—my
gold bought her—you stole her away,
dog of an American! No longer it is night—day
comes, and with it sweet vengeance. For
this I have waited—for this I have lived. It
pleased me to leave all and come here as a
merchant, that I might repay my debt. That
hour is here. It is my time to laugh. You
shall see!” With which sarcastic words the
Turkish plotter claps his hands loudly together.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="chaptitle">THE LAST ACT.</p>


<p>In all Eastern countries, where call bells are
unknown, servants are summoned by the clapping
of hands, a custom handed down from
Bible times. So when Aroun Scutari makes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
this signal he expects to have an answer.
Nor does he make a mistake.</p>

<p>From some other means of ingress figures
appear—men ready to obey his bidding. They
appear as though by magic; one, two, three
in all, and their looks are certainly fierce
enough to inspire alarm.</p>

<p>Again the pasha claps his hands with all
the gusto of a master of ceremonies. This
business suits him exactly, he is quite at
home.</p>

<p>The second signal brings a new surprise, for
as the heavy curtains part, a man, who is
plainly an American, is seen, leading a veiled
woman. Of course this is Anthony Wayne
and the one he believes to be Miss Dorothy,
for Samson Cereal has played his game well,
and the party employed to personate his
daughter is one of the shrewdest detectives
in Chicago.</p>

<p>The operator assumes much surprise at sight
of his secretary and valet.</p>

<p>“What, you, too, Anthony!” he exclaims,
in much the same tone Cæsar must have
employed when he saw Brutus among his
assailants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span></p>

<p>“Ze company is all here. There is no cause
for longer delay. For this hour I waited;
everything comes to him who waits. Listen
now, you wretch, who stole my bride years
ago. To pay me, you must even now give
Aroun Scutari your daughter for a wife.”</p>

<p>“It is you who are the wretch. I would
sooner see her dead than your wife. You are
many, I am one; but despair never gnawed
at my heart. Let him lay hands on me
who dares,” and the speculator of the Chicago
Bourse draws himself up defiantly.</p>

<p>None of them seem to be in any hurry, but
perhaps it is because they are so sure—because
they have other means at hand.</p>

<p>“Bah! shout if you will—no one can hear
you. It is our turn to laugh, and we shall
enjoy it, I assure you. I have asked for your
daughter—you refuse. Bismillah! she comes
to me of her own will.”</p>

<p>He points his trembling forefinger at the
veiled figure standing beside Anthony, and
his mocking laugh is enough to make one’s
blood run cold. These old Turks know how
to make of their revenge sweetness long drawn
out—they can lacerate their victims’ feelings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
even as vultures pick the flesh from the bones
of the dead placed in the Towers of Silence.</p>

<p>“Man, behold your child come to fill ze
place you made vacant in my heart when you
stole her mother from me. So shall ze revenge
of Aroun Scutari be complete. Look
upon her for ze last time, I tell you, for
you go not forth from here again. It is
decreed.”</p>

<p>With these last cutting words the Turk
steps forward and tears the veil away. His
manner is proud, disdainful. He feels as
though he has the destiny of all present within
the grasp of his hand, just as might a reckless
man who holds a dynamite bomb, and
looks around upon the men he hates.</p>

<p>As he does this, he receives the greatest
shock of his life. It almost paralyzes him.
He stares like a man demented.</p>

<p>Instead of the lovely features of Dorothy,
he sees the face of a man, and a very homely
face it is, to boot. The fellow shuts one eye
and ogles him in a ridiculous fashion. Aroun
Scutari is aghast at this failure of his plan.
He turns his gaze upon Wayne.</p>

<p>“Where is she—what have you brought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
me—zis <i>thing</i>? Speak, you slave, you dog of
an unbeliever!”</p>

<p>Perhaps it is his looks, but more probably
the gleaming yataghan he flashes from its
sheath that scares the amazed valet into
speech.</p>

<p>“I don’t know—I played my part—I believed
it was Miss Dorothy—there’s some
trickery here?” is what he gasps.</p>

<p>“Trickery! yes, I see; he believes he has
again outwitted a pasha. Once more I am
robbed of a bride, but this blade shall drink
his blood. It was forged in the fire of revenge!
Nothing can save you now, dog of a
Christian!”</p>

<p>The Turk has gone mad—his appearance is
positively fearful. Dante could find inspiration
for his pictures of the Inferno by looking
upon his frenzied countenance, scowling and
blazing with the wrath that has been bottled
up all these years, to burst its bonds at last.</p>

<p>He means every word he speaks, and backs
it up by swinging on high the flashing blade.</p>

<p>The extraordinary temper of Damascus
steel has long been the theme of song and
story, and the skill which the Saracens of old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
displayed in handling their precious blades
has been sung again and again. With a
strong and well-trained arm, vengeance-driven,
using such a weapon, it would not be difficult
to sever a man’s head from his body at a single
stroke.</p>

<p>As this yataghan, the pet weapon of Arab
and Algerian, cuts the air in flashing curves,
the tragedy of the Midway seems about to
reach its climax.</p>

<p>A scream breaks forth. Saidee, the fortune
teller, has thrown her form in front of the old
speculator.</p>

<p>“You shall not strike him save through my
heart, pasha!” she shrieks.</p>

<p>The Turk has started back as she comes between
his weapon and its intended victim;
but his confusion is only momentary. Then
over his dark face spreads a smile that is absolutely
fiendish. He intended taking one victim—two
will do just as well.</p>

<p>“Together, then, you shall die! I have
made a vow! A Turk always keeps his
word.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, but I’m afraid you lie,
pasha,” says Wycherley, as he strikes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
yataghan out of Scutari’s hand with a cudgel
he picks up from the floor. Then as he places
his foot upon the weapon, he continues calmly:
“My dear man, don’t you know the race isn’t
always to the swift? When you come to
America and buck against Chicago brain and
muscle it’s ten to one you go home a sadder
and a wiser man. That’s right, scowl as you
please, I’m quite impervious to it. Now you
feel for another weapon and start for me!
Well, I’m cheerfully on deck, every time.
Come on with your circus, band-wagon and all.
The show has begun and I am ready to play
my part.”</p>

<p>With considerable adroitness the ex-actor
has whipped out his bowie, and the other hand
withdraws the revolver that Wild Bill once
handled. Such a display might well cause
dismay even in the breast of a fire-eater, and
perhaps the Turk might have paused before
rushing to impale himself, but the detective
in woman’s clothes, feeling that he is expected
to do something more in order to earn
his fat fee, now fastens upon the back of the
pasha, just as the Old Man of the Sea did
upon Sinbad, and, pinioning his arms to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
sides, despite his mad bellowings, prevents
him from either flight or any dangerous
move.</p>

<p>Anthony Wayne turns to fly, but Aleck
gives him a whirl that sends him into a
corner. The three Turkish adherents of the
pasha have already dashed from the room by
means of the other exit.</p>

<p>Another scene is taking place on the right.
Dorothy has left Aleck’s side. Straight as
an arrow in its flight she passes to the
woman still kneeling at Samson’s feet. She
bends, she places her arms about Marda’s
neck, and into her ear she sobs:</p>

<p>“Oh, my mother, my mother!”</p>

<p>The woman snatches her in a fierce embrace.
Cheated by a cruel fate all these long years,
still the mother-love for its child has remained
within her heart, and now asserts its power.</p>

<p>Samson Cereal cannot gaze upon the spectacle
without deep emotion. Strange indeed
that two specters of his early life should thus
be resurrected so close together. It is true
that our destiny is often molded by unseen
hands.</p>

<p>Aleck goes over and takes hold of the valet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
who has played his master false. He brings
him to the speculator, cowering and trembling.</p>

<p>“Turn him around—so. I only want one
kick at the dog that could bite the hand
which has fed him. Now, go, and never let
me see your face again, you base wretch!”</p>

<p>Urged on by the impetus of the old operator’s
boot, Wayne flies through the passage,
bawling like a calf, but the dulcet sounds
of the wedding procession music still swell
through the narrow street, and no one would
be apt to pay any attention to such a small
outburst of anguish and fright as the discharged
valet gives vent to while he runs.</p>

<p>There remains only the Turk.</p>

<p>Having exhausted his fit of passion, and
finding he cannot break away from the strong
arms that pinion him, Scutari stands there
and glares into the face of his foe.</p>

<p>“What shall be done with this pretty
thing?” says that inveterate cuckoo, Wycherley.
“I think he can be locked up for five or
ten years at hard labor.”</p>

<p>The pasha hears; at first he looks defiant,
but at the mention of <i>work</i> he wilts like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
blighted flower. Such a fate would scare the
average Turk half to death.</p>

<p>“Anything but that! take my life if you
will, but to work like a slave, Allah deliver
me! I swear to you on the Koran that if you
allow me to depart, I will return to Stamboul
and never again remember that you live!” he
cries eagerly.</p>

<p>Samson Cereal hesitates, but from an unexpected
quarter help comes for the Turk.</p>

<p>“You can believe him. What a pasha
swears on the Koran, that he will do.”</p>

<p>It is Marda who speaks, and the speculator
makes up his mind.</p>

<p>“Pasha, you have played a bold game and
you have lost. Make up your mind to accept
the inevitable. As your people so philosophically
say, 'Kismet—it is fate.’ Go then
to your home, to your wives, on the Bosphorous.
Forget that we live. May our lives
never again cross.”</p>

<p>The pasha keeps his word, and before
another sun has set his face is turned toward
the Orient.</p>

<p>Under charge of Aleck and Wycherley the
two ladies—for they refuse to be separated—go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
to the princely home of the wheat king.
Samson Cereal soon leaves his friends and
joins them, for, even before the proof Marda
has promised is forthcoming, his heart
acquits her.</p>

<p>A singular meeting truly, between the two
women this man has loved, but both have
been purified by suffering, and Adela, knowing
her days are few, rejoices in the fact that
the girl she has already learned to love has
found a mother.</p>
